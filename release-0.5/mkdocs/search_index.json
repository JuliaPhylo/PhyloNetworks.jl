To install Julia, follow instructions \nhere\n. For a quick \n basic tutorial on Julia, see \nlearn x in y minutes\n.\n\n\nEditors:\n\n\n\n\nJuno\n provides an IDE for Julia, based on the (fantastic) \nAtom\n editor.\n\n\nyou can also run Julia within a \nJupyter\n notebook (formerly IPython notebook).\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Julia code is just-in-time compiled. This means that the first time you run a function, it will be compiled at that moment. So, please be patient! Future calls to the function will be much much faster. Trying out toy examples for the first calls is a good idea.\n\n\nUsers should have Julia 0.4 or above.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation of the package PhyloNetworks\n\n\nTo install the package, type inside Julia:\n\n\nPkg\n.\nadd\n(\nPhyloNetworks\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step can take a few minutes, be patient. If you already installed the package and want the latest registered version, just do this (which will update all of your packages):\n\n\nPkg\n.\nupdate\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: It is important to update the package regularly as it is undergoing constant development. Join the google group for updates \nhere\n.\n\n\nPkg.update()\n will install the latest registered version, but there could be other improvements in the \nmaster\n branch of the repository. If you want to update to the latest unregistered version of the package, you can do \nPkg.checkout(\"PhyloNetworks\")\n just beware that the latest changes could be not as robust. If you want to go back to the registered package, you can do \nPkg.free(\"PhyloNetworks\")\n.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can pin a version of the package \nPkg.pin(\"PhyloNetworks\")\n so that \nPkg.update()\n will not modify it. You can always free a pinned package with \nPkg.free(\"PhyloNetworks\")\n. More on checked and pinned packages \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PhyloNetworks package has dependencies like NLopt and Gadfly (see the REQUIRE file for the full list), but everything is installed automatically.\n\n\n\n\nTest example\n\n\nTo check that your installation worked, type this in Julia to load the package. This is something to type every time you start a Julia session:\n\n\nusing\n \nPhyloNetworks\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step can also take a while, if Julia needs to pre-compile the code (after a package update for instance). Here is a very small test for the installation of PhyloNetworks.\n\n\nnet\n \n=\n \nreadTopology\n(\n(A,(B,(C,D)));\n);\n\n\ntipLabels\n(\nnet\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-element Array{String,1}:\n \nA\n\n \nB\n\n \nC\n\n \nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see a list of all the functions with\n\n\nwhos\n(\nPhyloNetworks\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand press \n?\n inside Julia to switch to help mode, followed by the name of a function (or type) to get more details about it.\n\n\n\n\nJulia types\n\n\nObjects in Julia are called \ntypes\n. We show here small example on how to get more info on an object, what's its type, and how to manipulate objects. For example, let's take an object \nraxmlCF\n created from reading in some data (see \nInput for SNaQ\n):\n\n\nraxmltrees\n \n=\n \njoinpath\n(\nPkg\n.\ndir\n(\nPhyloNetworks\n),\nexamples\n,\nraxmltrees.tre\n)\n\n\nraxmlCF\n \n=\n \nreadTrees2CF\n(\nraxmltrees\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyping \nwhos()\n will provide a list of objects and packages in memory, including \nraxmlCF\n that we just created. If we want to know the type of a particular object, we do:\n\n\njulia\n \ntypeof\n(\nraxmlCF\n)\n\n\nPhyloNetworks\n.\nDataCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich shows us that \nraxmlCF\n is of type \nDataCF\n. If we want to know about the attributes the object has, we can type \n?\n in Julia, followed by \nDataCF\n for a description. We can also ask for a list of all its attributes with\n\n\njulia\n \nfieldnames\n(\nraxmlCF\n)\n\n\n5\n-\nelement\n \nArray\n{\nSymbol\n,\n1\n}\n:\n\n \n:\nquartet\n    \n \n:\nnumQuartets\n\n \n:\ntree\n       \n \n:\nnumTrees\n   \n \n:\nrepSpecies\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, we see that one attribute is \nnumQuartets\n: its the number of 4-taxon subsets in the data. To see what this number is:\n\n\njulia\n \nraxmlCF\n.\nnumQuartets\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also noticed an attribute \nquartet\n. It is a vector of Quartet objects inside \nraxmlCF\n, so\n\n\njulia\n \nraxmlCF\n.\nquartet\n[\n2\n]\n.\ntaxon\n\n\n4\n-\nelement\n \nArray\n{\nString\n,\n1\n}\n:\n\n \nA\n\n \nB\n\n \nC\n\n \nE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill provide the list of taxon names for the second 4-taxon subset in the data. To see the observed CF, we can type\n\n\njulia\n \nraxmlCF\n.\nquartet\n[\n2\n]\n.\nobsCF\n\n\n3\n-\nelement\n \nArray\n{\nFloat64\n,\n1\n}\n:\n\n \n0.833333\n \n \n0.0333333\n\n \n0.133333\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can verify the type with\n\n\njulia\n \ntypeof\n(\nraxmlCF\n.\nquartet\n[\n2\n])\n\n\nPhyloNetworks\n.\nQuartet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also read a simple network in Julia and print the list of edges\n\n\njulia\n \nstr\n \n=\n \n(A,((B,#H1),(C,(D)#H1)));\n;\n\n\n\njulia\n \nnet\n \n=\n \nreadTopology\n(\nstr\n)\n\n\nPhyloNetworks\n.\nHybridNetwork\n,\n \nRooted\n \nNetwork\n\n\n9\n \nedges\n\n\n9\n \nnodes\n:\n \n4\n \ntips\n,\n \n1\n \nhybrid\n \nnodes\n,\n \n4\n \ninternal\n \ntree\n \nnodes\n.\n\n\ntip\n \nlabels\n:\n \nA\n,\n \nB\n,\n \nC\n,\n \nD\n\n\n(\nA\n,((\nB\n,\n#H1),(C,(D)#H1)));\n\n\n\n\njulia\n \nprintEdges\n(\nnet\n)\n\n\nEdge\n    \nNode1\n   \nNode2\n   \nInCycle\n \ncontainRoot\n \nistIdentitiable\n \nLength\n  \nisHybrid\n    \nGamma\n   \nisMajor\n\n\n1\n   \n1\n   \n-\n2\n  \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \nfalse\n       \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n2\n   \n2\n   \n-\n4\n  \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \nfalse\n       \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n3\n   \n-\n4\n  \n3\n   \n-\n1\n  \nfalse\n       \nfalse\n       \nNA\n  \ntrue\n        \n-\n1.0\n    \nfalse\n\n\n4\n   \n-\n4\n  \n-\n3\n  \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \ntrue\n        \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n5\n   \n4\n   \n-\n5\n  \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \nfalse\n       \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n6\n   \n5\n   \n3\n   \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \nfalse\n       \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n7\n   \n3\n   \n-\n5\n  \n-\n1\n  \nfalse\n       \ntrue\n        \nNA\n  \ntrue\n        \n-\n1.0\n    \ntrue\n\n\n8\n   \n-\n5\n  \n-\n3\n  \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \ntrue\n        \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n9\n   \n-\n3\n  \n-\n2\n  \n-\n1\n  \ntrue\n        \ntrue\n        \nNA\n  \nfalse\n       \n1.0\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the edges do not have branch lengths, and the hybrid edges do not have gamma values.

If we want to know the type of a particular object, we do:  julia   typeof ( raxmlCF )  PhyloNetworks . DataCF   which shows us that  raxmlCF  is of type  DataCF . If we want to know about the attributes the object has, we can type  ?  in Julia, followed by  DataCF  for a description.

To see what this number is:  julia   raxmlCF . numQuartets  15   We also noticed an attribute  quartet . It is a vector of Quartet objects inside  raxmlCF , so  julia   raxmlCF . quartet [ 2 ] . taxon  4 - element   Array { String , 1 } : \n  A \n  B \n  C \n  E   will provide the list of taxon names for the second 4-taxon subset in the data.

There are two alternatives for the input data:\n\n\n\n\nA list of estimated gene trees for each locus, which can be obtained using \nMrBayes\n or \nRAxML\n. Or:\n\n\nA table of concordance factors (CF), i.e. gene tree frequencies, for each 4-taxon subset. This table can be obtained from \nBUCKy\n, to account for gene tree uncertainty\n\n\n\n\nThis \npipeline\n can be used to obtain the table of quartet CF needed as input for SNaQ (see also the \nwiki\n.) It starts from the sequence alignments, runs MrBayes and then BUCKy (both parallelized), producing the table of estimated CFs and their credibility intervals. Additional details on this \nTICR pipeline\n describe how to insert data at various stages (e.g. after running MrBayes on each locus).\n\n\n\n\nTutorial data: gene trees\n\n\nWe suggest that you create a special directory for running these examples, where input files can be downloaded and where output files will be created (with estimated networks for instance).

To get a predictable random sample, you may set the seed with \nsrand(12321)\n (for instance) prior to sampling the quartets as above.\n\n\n\n\nTutorial data: quartet CFs\n\n\nIf we already have a table of quartet concordance factor (CF) values in a file \nbuckyCF.csv\n in this format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxon1\n\n\nTaxon2\n\n\nTaxon3\n\n\nTaxon4\n\n\nCF12_34\n\n\nCF13_24\n\n\nCF14_23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nA\n\n\nE\n\n\nO\n\n\n0.565\n\n\n0.0903\n\n\n0.3447\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe would read it in one step like this: \nreadTableCF(\"buckyCF.csv\")\n.

the input file, columns need to be in the right order: with the first 4 columns giving the names of the taxa in each 4-taxon set. The CF values are assumed to be in columns named \"CF12_34\", etc., or else in columns 5,6,7. If available, a column named \"ngenes\" will be taken to have the the number of genes for each 4-taxon subset.\n\n\n\n\nTutorial data: starting tree\n\n\nIf we have a tree for the data set at hand, it can be used as a starting point for the optimization. From our gene trees, we estimated a species tree with \nASTRAL\n. This tree comes with the package in file \nastral.tre\n \nhere\n. This file has 102 trees: 100 bootstrap species trees, followed by their greedy consensus, followed by the best tree on the original data. It's this last tree that we are most interested in. We can read it with\n\n\nastralfile\n \n=\n \njoinpath\n(\nPkg\n.\ndir\n(\nPhyloNetworks\n),\nexamples\n,\nastral.tre\n)\n\n\nastraltree\n \n=\n \nreadMultiTopology\n(\nastralfile\n)[\n102\n]\n \n# 102th tree = last tree here\n\n\nplot\n(\nastraltree\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start its search, SNaQ will need a network of \"level 1\". All trees and all networks with 1 hybridization are of level 1. To make sure that a network with 2 or more hybridizations is of level 1, we can read it in with \nreadTopologyLevel1\n (which also unroots the tree, resolves polytomies, replaces missing branch lengths by 1 for starting values etc.):\n\n\nT\n=\nreadTopologyLevel1\n(\nstartNetwork.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(here \nstartNetwork.txt\n is a hypothetical file: replace this by the name of a file that contains your network of interest.)\n\n\nNext: \nGetting a Network",

There are two alternatives for the input data:   A list of estimated gene trees for each locus, which can be obtained using  MrBayes  or  RAxML . Or:  A table of concordance factors (CF), i.e. gene tree frequencies, for each 4-taxon subset. This table can be obtained from  BUCKy , to account for gene tree uncertainty   This  pipeline  can be used to obtain the table of quartet CF needed as input for SNaQ (see also the  wiki .) It starts from the sequence alignments, runs MrBayes and then BUCKy (both parallelized), producing the table of estimated CFs and their credibility intervals. Additional details on this  TICR pipeline  describe how to insert data at various stages (e.g. after running MrBayes on each locus).",

            "text": "TICR pipeline\n\n\nPhyloNetworks' \nwiki\n has a step-by-step tutorial, to go from multiple sequence alignments to a table of quartet gene frequencies (concordance factors: CFs), through BUCKy (to integrate out gene tree uncertainty) or through RAxML. To get the \nraxml.pl\n perl script to run RAxML on each gene, download the content of that wiki with\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl.wiki.git\n\n\nthen go to the \nscript/\n folder.   Below is more detail to insert data into the TICR pipeline at various stages. Full information and code for this pipeline is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo run MrBayes: You already have alignments\n\n\nIf you don't need to run mdl.pl because you already have aligned gene sequences which you would like to run through MrBayes, you can simply create a tarball of the Nexus files (fasta won't work at this stage) you wish to use. This command assumes that you want to use all the files ending with \".nex\" in the current directory, one file per locus:\n\n\ntar czf my-genes.tar.gz *.nex\n\n\nOnce the tarball has been successfully generated, you can then specify this file as input for \nmb.pl\n assuming you have a a valid MrBayes block located in the file \"bayes.txt\":\n\n\nmb.pl my-genes.tar.gz -m bayes.txt -o my-genes-mb\n\n\nIf you get an error message like \nmb.pl: Command not found\n, it might be because \nmb.pl\n has no execute permission or your current directory is not in your path. An easy fix is to run this command instead:\n\n\nperl mb.pl my-genes.tar.gz -m bayes.txt -o my-genes-mb\n\n\nThe resulting output tarball would now be located in my-genes-mb/my-genes.mb.tar, and can be used normally with \nbucky.pl\n, that is, like this:\n\n\nbucky.pl my-genes-mb/my-genes.mb.tar -o mygenes-bucky\n\n\nThe output, with the table of concordance factors for all sets of 4 taxa, will be in a file named \nmy-genes.CFs.csv\n inside a directory named \nmygenes-bucky\n. That's the file containing the quartet concordance factors to give to SNaQ as input.\n\n\n\n\nTo run BUCKy: You already have MrBayes output\n\n\n\n\nTo run mbsum on the output of MrBayes for each gene\n\n\nYou must now run \nmbsum\n separately on each gene's MrBayes output.

The direction of hybrid edges can be inferred, but the direction of tree edges cannot be inferred. To obtain a representative visualization, it is best to root the network first, using one or more outgroup. Go to \nComparing and manipulating networks\n for this.\n\n\n\n\nCandidate Network Evaluation\n\n\nFrom a set of candidate networks, one might simply need to score of each network to pick the best. Here, the score is the negative log pseudo-likelihood, and the lower the better. See the section to get the score of \nCandidate Networks\n.\n\n\n\n\nSNaQ error reporting\n\n\nPlease report any bugs and errors by opening an \nissue\n. The easiest way to provide information on the error is by checking the \n.err\n file, which will show the number of runs that failed and the corresponding seed to replicate the run. In case of an error, the \n.err\n file might look like: \nTotal errors: 1 in seeds [4545]\n. To replicate the bug (necessary to fix it!), you can run the following function with the same settings that caused the error:\n\n\nsnaqDebug\n(\nstartnetwork\n,\n \nraxmlCF\n,\n \nhmax\n=\n2\n,\n \nseed\n=\n4545\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will create two files: \nsnaqDebug.log\n and \ndebug.log\n, with information on steps to retrace the bug. You can attach them to your issue (or send them offline), to help us fix the bug.",

These functions update the fitted concordance factors (those expected under the network) inside the DataCF object  raxmlCF .  Now, we can plot them with any of the Julia packages for plotting. For example:  using   Gadfly  plot ( layer ( df_long ,   Geom . point ,   x = obsCF ,   y = expCF ), \n      layer ( x = 0 : 1 , y = 0 : 1 ,   Geom . line ),   # diagonal line \n      Guide . xlabel ( CF observed in gene trees ),   Guide . ylabel ( CF expected from network ))    To export this table and explore the fit of the network with other tools:  writetable ( fittedCF.csv ,   df_long )   To highlight quartets that include taxon A, say, if we suspect that it is an unrecognized hybrid, one may do this. But very many points are overlapping, and this particular plot is not very satisfying as it is.  using   DataFramesMeta   # install this package with Pkg.add( DataFramesMeta ) if not done before  mycolor   =   @with ( df_long ,   ( : tx1   .==   A )   |   ( : tx2   .==   A )   |   ( : tx3   .==   A )   |   ( : tx4   .==   A ));  #  mycolor  is true for quartets having taxon A, false for others  plot ( layer ( df_long ,   x = obsCF ,   y = expCF ,   color = mycolor ,   Geom . point ), \n      layer ( x = 0 : 1 , y = 0 : 1 ,   Geom . line ), \n      Guide . colorkey ( has taxon A? ))",

            "text": "Bootstrap\n\n\n\n\nRunning a bootstrap analysis\n\n\nThere are two ways to do a bootstrap analysis.\n\n\n\n\nFrom quartet CFs with credibility intervals, such as if we used BUCKy. The \nTICR pipeline\n outpus a CF table with extra columns for credibility intervals. We could then read that table and get bootstrap networks like this, and tweak options as needed:\n\n\n\n\nusing\n \nDataFrames\n\n\ndf\n \n=\n \nreadtable\n(\ntableCF_withCI.csv\n)\n\n\nbootnet\n \n=\n \nbootsnaq\n(\nstartnetwork\n,\n \ndf\n,\n \nhmax\n=\n1\n,\n \nfilename\n=\nbootstrap\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use bootstrap gene trees: one file of bootstrap trees per gene. Here, the input is a text file that lists all the bootstrap files (one per gene). We demonstrate this option here.\n\n\n\n\nThe names of all our bootstrap files are listed in \"BSlistfiles\". (ASTRAL can use the same file to do its own bootstrap, see the \nwiki\n for more details). The function \nreadBootstrapTrees\n can read this list of file names, then read each bootstrap file to get the bootstrap sample for each gene. We can use them to sample input gene trees at random, one per gene, and estimate a network from them. We ask the \nbootsnaq\n function to repeat this resampling of bootstrap gene trees several times.\n\n\nbootTrees\n \n=\n \nreadBootstrapTrees\n(\nBSlistfiles\n);\n\n\nbootnet\n \n=\n \nbootsnaq\n(\nnet0\n,\n \nbootTrees\n,\n \nhmax\n=\n1\n,\n \nnrep\n=\n10\n,\n \nruns\n=\n3\n,\n \nfilename\n=\nbootsnaq\n,\n \nseed\n=\n4321\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bootstrap networks are saved in the \nboostrap.out\n file, so they can be read in a new session with \nbootnet = readMultiTopology(\"bootsnap.out\")\n. To save the bootstrap networks to a different file (perhaps after having re-rooted them with an outgroup), we could do this: \nwriteMultiTopology(bootnet, \"bootstrapNets.tre\")\n.\n\n\nThe example above asks for 10 bootstrap replicates, which is definitely too few, to make the example run faster. We might also increase the number of optimization runs (\nruns\n) done for each bootstrap replicate. This bootstrap was run with the default 10 runs per replicate, and 100 bootstrap replicates, and the 100 bootstrap networks come with the package:\n\n\njulia\n \nbootnet\n \n=\n \nreadMultiTopology\n(\nPkg\n.\ndir\n(\nPhyloNetworks\n,\nexamples\n,\nbootsnaq.out\n));\n\n\n\njulia\n \nlength\n(\nbootnet\n)\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we used a specified list of quartets on the original data, we should use that same list for the bootstrap analysis through the option \nquartetfile\n.\n\n\n\n\nsupport for tree edges\n\n\nNow that we have 100 bootstrap networks, we need to summarize what they have in common (highly supported features) and what they don't (areas of uncertainty).\n\n\nBefore summarizing these bootstrap networks on the best network, it is best to re-read this network to get a reproducible internal numbering of its nodes and edges, used later for mapping bootstrap support to edges.\n\n\nnet1\n \n=\n \nreadTopology\n(\njoinpath\n(\nPkg\n.\ndir\n(\nPhyloNetworks\n),\nexamples\n,\nnet1.out\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that the direction of gene flow is quite uncertain in this example (see below) with a wrong direction inferred sometimes, so we re-root our best network net1 to the base of O,E, for the figures to be less confusing later.\n\n\nusing\n \nDataFrames\n\n\nplot\n(\nnet1\n,\n \nshowEdgeNumber\n=\ntrue\n)\n \n# edge 7 leads to O+E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrootonedge!\n(\nnet1\n,\n \n7\n)\n \n# makes (O,E) outgroup clade\n\n\nplot\n(\nnet1\n,\n \nshowNodeNumber\n=\ntrue\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedges cross: but rotating at node -6 should remove this crossing of edges\n\n\nrotate!\n(\nnet1\n,\n \n-\n6\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nnet1\n,\n \nshowGamma\n=\ntrue\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now summarize our bootstrap networks. The functions \ntreeEdgesBootstrap\n and \nhybridBootstrapSupport\n read all bootstrap networks and map the edges / nodes onto a reference network: here net1.\n\n\nBSe_tree\n,\n \ntree1\n \n=\n \ntreeEdgesBootstrap\n(\nbootnet\n,\nnet1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis calculates the major tree \ntree1\n displayed in \nnet1\n, that is, the tree obtained by following the major parent (\u03b3\n0.5) of each hybrid node. This tree can be visualized like this, with edge numbers shown for later use.\n\n\nplot\n(\ntree1\n,\n \nshowEdgeNumber\n=\ntrue\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can look at bootstrap table \nBSe_tree\n, which has one row for each tree edge in \nnet1\n. One column contains the edge number (same as shown in the plot) and another column contains the edge bootstrap support: the proportion of bootstrap replicates in which this edge was found in the major tree of the inferred network. We can see the full bootstrap table and see which tree edges have bootstrap support lower than 100% (none here) with\n\n\njulia\n \nshowall\n(\nBSe_tree\n)\n\n\n3\n\u00d72\n \nDataFrames\n.\nDataFrame\n\n\n\u2502\n \nRow\n \n\u2502\n \nedgeNumber\n \n\u2502\n \nproportion\n \n\u2502\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\n\n\n\u2502\n \n1\n   \n\u2502\n \n13\n         \n\u2502\n \n100.0\n      \n\u2502\n\n\n\u2502\n \n2\n   \n\u2502\n \n11\n         \n\u2502\n \n100.0\n      \n\u2502\n\n\n\u2502\n \n3\n   \n\u2502\n \n12\n         \n\u2502\n \n100.0\n      \n\u2502\n\n\njulia\n \nBSe_tree\n[\nBSe_tree\n[\n:\nproportion\n]\n \n.\n \n100.0\n,\n \n:\n]\n\n\n0\n\u00d72\n \nDataFrames\n.\nDataFrame\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can map the bootstrap proportions onto the network or its main tree by passing the bootstrap table to the \nedgeLabel\n option of \nplot\n:\n\n\nplot\n(\ntree1\n,\n \nedgeLabel\n=\nBSe_tree\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot\n(\nnet1\n,\n  \nedgeLabel\n=\nBSe_tree\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Here, it is important that the numbers assigned to edges when building the boostrap table \u2013those in \nnet1\n at the time\u2013 correspond to the current edge numbers in \ntree1\n and \nnet1\n. That was the purpose of reading the network from the output file of \nsnaq!\n earlier, for consistency across different Julia sessions.)\n\n\nIf we wanted to plot only certain bootstrap values, like those below 100% (1.0), we could do this:\n\n\nplot\n(\nnet1\n,\n \nedgeLabel\n=\nBSe_tree\n[\nBSe_tree\n[\n:\nproportion\n]\n \n.\n \n100.0\n,\n \n:\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupport for hybrid edges and hybrid nodes\n\n\nSummarizing the placement of reticulations is not standard. The function \nhybridBootstrapSupport\n attempts to do so. The descendants of a given hybrid node form the \"recipient\" or \"hybrid\" clade, and is obtained after removing all other reticulations. If reticulation is due to gene flow or introgression, the minor hybrid edge (with \u03b3\n0.5) represents this event. The descendants of the lineage from which gene flow originated is then a second \"sister\" of the hybrid clade. Because of the reticulation event, the hybrid clade has 2 sister clades, not 1: the major sister (through the major hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5) and the minor sister (through the minor hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5). Note that the network says \nnothing\n about the process: its shows the \nrelationships\n only. We can calculate the frequency that each clade is a hybrid clade, or a major or minor sister for some other hybrid, in the bootstrap networks:\n\n\nBSn\n,\n \nBSe\n,\n \nBSc\n,\n \nBSgam\n,\n \nBSedgenum\n \n=\n \nhybridBootstrapSupport\n(\nbootnet\n,\n \nnet1\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the results.

The clade found in the best network is listed with its tag, starting with H (e.g. \"H7\"). The name of other clades start with \"c_\" followed by their number in the best network, if they do appear in the best network. The node numbers, as used internally in the best network, are listed in a separate column. They can be used later to display the bootstrap support values onto the network. Various columns give the bootstrap support that each clade is a hybrid, or a (major/minor) sister to a hybrid. The last column gives the bootstrap support for the full relationship in the best network: same hybrid with same two sisters. These bootstrap values are associated with nodes (or possibly, their parent edges).\n\n\nTo see what is the clade named \"H7\", for instance:\n\n\njulia\n \nBSc\n \n# this might be too

The  TICR pipeline  outpus a CF table with extra columns for credibility intervals. We could then read that table and get bootstrap networks like this, and tweak options as needed:   using   DataFrames  df   =   readtable ( tableCF_withCI.csv )  bootnet   =   bootsnaq ( startnetwork ,   df ,   hmax = 1 ,   filename = bootstrap )    Alternatively, we can use bootstrap gene trees: one file of bootstrap trees per gene. Here, the input is a text file that lists all the bootstrap files (one per gene). We demonstrate this option here.   The names of all our bootstrap files are listed in \"BSlistfiles\". (ASTRAL can use the same file to do its own bootstrap, see the  wiki  for more details). The function  readBootstrapTrees  can read this list of file names, then read each bootstrap file to get the bootstrap sample for each gene. We can use them to sample input gene trees at random, one per gene, and estimate a network from them. We ask the  bootsnaq  function to repeat this resampling of bootstrap gene trees several times.  bootTrees   =   readBootstrapTrees ( BSlistfiles );  bootnet   =   bootsnaq ( net0 ,   bootTrees ,   hmax = 1 ,   nrep = 10 ,   runs = 3 ,   filename = bootsnaq ,   seed = 4321 )   The bootstrap networks are saved in the  boostrap.out  file, so they can be read in a new session with  bootnet = readMultiTopology(\"bootsnap.out\") . To save the bootstrap networks to a different file (perhaps after having re-rooted them with an outgroup), we could do this:  writeMultiTopology(bootnet, \"bootstrapNets.tre\") .  The example above asks for 10 bootstrap replicates, which is definitely too few, to make the example run faster. We might also increase the number of optimization runs ( runs ) done for each bootstrap replicate. This bootstrap was run with the default 10 runs per replicate, and 100 bootstrap replicates, and the 100 bootstrap networks come with the package:  julia   bootnet   =   readMultiTopology ( Pkg . dir ( PhyloNetworks , examples , bootsnaq.out ));  julia   length ( bootnet )  100   If we used a specified list of quartets on the original data, we should use that same list for the bootstrap analysis through the option  quartetfile .",

Before summarizing these bootstrap networks on the best network, it is best to re-read this network to get a reproducible internal numbering of its nodes and edges, used later for mapping bootstrap support to edges.  net1   =   readTopology ( joinpath ( Pkg . dir ( PhyloNetworks ), examples , net1.out ))   It turns out that the direction of gene flow is quite uncertain in this example (see below) with a wrong direction inferred sometimes, so we re-root our best network net1 to the base of O,E, for the figures to be less confusing later.  using   DataFrames  plot ( net1 ,   showEdgeNumber = true )   # edge 7 leads to O+E    rootonedge! ( net1 ,   7 )   # makes (O,E) outgroup clade  plot ( net1 ,   showNodeNumber = true )    edges cross: but rotating at node -6 should remove this crossing of edges  rotate! ( net1 ,   - 6 )  plot ( net1 ,   showGamma = true )    We can now summarize our bootstrap networks. The functions  treeEdgesBootstrap  and  hybridBootstrapSupport  read all bootstrap networks and map the edges / nodes onto a reference network: here net1.  BSe_tree ,   tree1   =   treeEdgesBootstrap ( bootnet , net1 )   This calculates the major tree  tree1  displayed in  net1 , that is, the tree obtained by following the major parent (\u03b3 0.5) of each hybrid node. This tree can be visualized like this, with edge numbers shown for later use.  plot ( tree1 ,   showEdgeNumber = true )    Next, we can look at bootstrap table  BSe_tree , which has one row for each tree edge in  net1 . One column contains the edge number (same as shown in the plot) and another column contains the edge bootstrap support: the proportion of bootstrap replicates in which this edge was found in the major tree of the inferred network. We can see the full bootstrap table and see which tree edges have bootstrap support lower than 100% (none here) with  julia   showall ( BSe_tree )  3 \u00d72   DataFrames .

DataFrame   Finally, we can map the bootstrap proportions onto the network or its main tree by passing the bootstrap table to the  edgeLabel  option of  plot :  plot ( tree1 ,   edgeLabel = BSe_tree )    plot ( net1 ,    edgeLabel = BSe_tree )    (Here, it is important that the numbers assigned to edges when building the boostrap table \u2013those in  net1  at the time\u2013 correspond to the current edge numbers in  tree1  and  net1 . That was the purpose of reading the network from the output file of  snaq!  earlier, for consistency across different Julia sessions.)  If we wanted to plot only certain bootstrap values, like those below 100% (1.0), we could do this:  plot ( net1 ,   edgeLabel = BSe_tree [ BSe_tree [ : proportion ]   .   100.0 ,   : ])",

            "text": "Summarizing the placement of reticulations is not standard. The function  hybridBootstrapSupport  attempts to do so. The descendants of a given hybrid node form the \"recipient\" or \"hybrid\" clade, and is obtained after removing all other reticulations. If reticulation is due to gene flow or introgression, the minor hybrid edge (with \u03b3 0.5) represents this event. The descendants of the lineage from which gene flow originated is then a second \"sister\" of the hybrid clade. Because of the reticulation event, the hybrid clade has 2 sister clades, not 1: the major sister (through the major hybrid edge with \u03b3 0.5) and the minor sister (through the minor hybrid edge with \u03b3 0.5). Note that the network says  nothing  about the process: its shows the  relationships  only. We can calculate the frequency that each clade is a hybrid clade, or a major or minor sister for some other hybrid, in the bootstrap networks:  BSn ,   BSe ,   BSc ,   BSgam ,   BSedgenum   =   hybridBootstrapSupport ( bootnet ,   net1 );   Let's look at the results.

The name of other clades start with \"c_\" followed by their number in the best network, if they do appear in the best network. The node numbers, as used internally in the best network, are listed in a separate column. They can be used later to display the bootstrap support values onto the network. Various columns give the bootstrap support that each clade is a hybrid, or a (major/minor) sister to a hybrid. The last column gives the bootstrap support for the full relationship in the best network: same hybrid with same two sisters.

In our case, there is only one reticulation, so only 2 hybrid edges.  We can plot the bootstrap values of the 2 hybrid edges in the best network:  plot ( net1 ,   edgeLabel = BSe [[ : edge , : BS_hybrid_edge ]])    This is showing the bootstrap support each hybrid edge: percentage of bootstrap trees with an edge from the same sister clade to the same hybrid clade. Alternatively, we could show the bootstrap support for the full reticulation relationships in the network, one at each hybrid node (support for same hybrid with same sister clades). Here, we find that A received gene flow from E (and is sister to B otherwise) in just 32% of bootstrap networks. In another 1% bootstrap, A received gene flow from another source.  plot ( net1 ,   nodeLabel = BSn [[ : hybridnode , : BS_hybrid_samesisters ]])    Below is example code to place tree edge support and hybrid edge support on the same plot.  tmp   =   BSe [ ! isna ( BSe [ : edge ]),[ : edge , : BS_hybrid_edge ]]  rename!

In another 49%, it is the lineage to A that is estimated as the  origin  of gene flow: so gene flow is estimated in the opposite direction. In this example, there is support for gene flow between (A,B) and (E,O), but there is much uncertainty about its exact placement and about its direction.

If needed, we could also extract the simulated values at the internal nodes in the tre:\n\n\nsim1\n[\n:\nInternalNodes\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we generate the last trait correlated with trait 1 (but not trait 2), with phylogenetic noise.\n\n\nsrand\n(\n18700904\n)\n\n\nnoise\n \n=\n \nsimulate\n(\ntruenet\n,\n \nParamsBM\n(\n0\n,\n \n0.1\n))\n \n# phylogenetic residuals\n\n\ntrait3\n \n=\n \n10\n \n+\n \n2\n \n*\n \ntrait1\n \n+\n \nnoise\n[\n:\nTips\n]\n \n# trait to study. independent of trait2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic regression\n\n\nAssume that we measured the three traits above, and that we wanted to study the impact of traits 1 and 2 on trait 3.

In addition, the Student test for the coefficient associated with trait 2 has a high p-value, which means that this coefficient is not significantly different from 0. This is consistent with the way we simulated trait 3.\n\n\nThe function returns an object of type \nPhyloNetworkLinearModel\n:LinPredModel\n. It is a subtype of the GLM type \nLinPredModel\n, which means that all base functions from Julia \nStatsBase\n can be applied to it. See the documentation for this type for a list of all functions that can be used. Some functions allow the user to retrieve directly the estimated parameters of the BM, and are specific to this object.\n\n\n\n\nAncestral State Reconstruction\n\n\n\n\nFrom known parameters\n\n\nIf we assume that we know the exact model of evolution that generated the traits, we can do ancestral trait reconstruction. Here, we simulated trait 1 ourselves, so we can use the true process, with the true parameters. In other words, we can reconstruct the state at the internal nodes, given the values at the tips, the known value at the root and the known BM variance.\n\n\nancTrait1\n \n=\n \nancestralStateReconstruction\n(\ntruenet\n,\n \ntrait1\n,\n \nparams_trait1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction \nancestralStateReconstruction\n creates an object with type \nReconstructedStates\n.

We can estimate it using the previous function. To fit a regular BM, we just need to do a regression of trait 1 against a simple intercept:\n\n\nfitTrait1\n \n=\n \nphyloNetworklm\n(\n@formula\n(\ntrait1\n \n~\n \n1\n),\n \ndat\n,\n \ntruenet\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then apply the \nancestralStateReconstruction\n function directly to the fitted object:\n\n\nancTrait1Approx\n \n=\n \nancestralStateReconstruction\n(\nfitTrait1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prediction intervals ignore the fact that we estimated the process parameters, so they are less accurate and the function throws a warning. The output is an object of the same \nReconstructedStates\n type as earlier, and the same extractors can be applied to it:\n\n\nplot\n(\ntruenet\n,\n \nnodeLabel\n \n=\n \nexpectationsPlot\n(\nancTrait1Approx\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor convenience, the two steps described above (fitting against the intercept, and then do ancestral state reconstruction) can be done all at once with a single call of the function \nancestralStateReconstruction\n on a DataFrame with the trait to reconstruct, and the tip labels:\n\n\ndatTrait1\n \n=\n \nDataFrame\n(\ntrait1\n \n=\n \ntrait1\n,\n \ntipNames\n \n=\n \ntipLabels\n(\nsim1\n))\n\n\nancTrait1Approx\n \n=\n \nancestralStateReconstruction\n(\ndatTrait1\n,\n \ntruenet\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\ntruenet\n,\n \nnodeLabel\n \n=\n \npredintPlot\n(\nancTrait1Approx\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis produces the exact same results.\n\n\n\n\nData imputation\n\n\nNote that there is no theoretical difference between an internal node, for which we could not measure the value of the trait, and a missing value at a tip of the network. Consequently, the previous \nancestralStateReconstruction\n function can be used to do data imputation. To see this, let's add some missing values in trait 1.\n\n\ndatTrait1\n[[\n2\n],\n \n:\ntrait1\n]\n \n=\n \nNA\n \n# second row: for taxon C\n\n\nancTrait1Approx\n \n=\n \nancestralStateReconstruction\n(\ndatTrait1\n,\n \ntruenet\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\ntruenet\n,\n \nnodeLabel\n \n=\n \npredintPlot\n(\nancTrait1Approx\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plotting function, a prediction interval is shown for the missing values.\n\n\n\n\nWith known predictors\n\n\nAt this point, it might be tempting to apply this function to trait 3 we simulated earlier as a linear combination of trait 1 and a phylogenetic noise. However, this cannot be done directly:\n\n\nancTrait3\n \n=\n \nancestralStateReconstruction\n(\nfitTrait3\n)\n \n# Throws an error !\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because the model we used to fit the trait (a regression with one predictor and an intercept) is not compatible with the simple model of Brownian evolution that we assumed for the ancestral state reconstruction. As the predictor used is not known for ancestral states, it is not possible to reconstruct the trait for this particular model.\n\n\nThe only option we have is to provide the function with the predictor's ancestral states, if they are known. They are known indeed in this toy example that we generated ourselves, so we can reconstruct our trait doing the following:\n\n\nancTrait3\n \n=\n \nancestralStateReconstruction\n(\nfitTrait3\n,\n\n              \n[\nones\n(\n7\n,\n \n1\n)\n \nsim1\n[\n:\nInternalNodes\n]\n \nsim2\n[\n:\nInternalNodes\n]])\n\n\nplot\n(\ntruenet\n,\n \nnodeLabel\n \n=\n \npredintPlot\n(\nancTrait3\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere we provided the ancestral predictors as a matrix, containing the intercept, and the known predictor at the nodes. The user must be very careful with this function, as no check is done for the order of the predictors, that must be in the same order as the internal nodes of the phylogeny. As ancestral predictors are often unknown, the use of this functionality is discouraged.\n\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic ANOVA\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the \nphyloNetworklm\n function is based on the \nlm\n function from \nGLM\n. This means that it inherits from most of its features, and in particular, it can handle formulas with factors or interactions. For example, in lizards, we might want to do a regression of toe length against body length and the region where each species is found, where this region is coded into 4 categories (say). We might also want to include an interaction effect between body length and region. (This model has no biological basis. It is just meant to show the possibilities of the function).\n\n\nTo illustrate the use of categorical predictors of particular interest in a network with reticulations, let's assume that some heterosis took place after the hybridization event, so that tips \"A\" and \"B\" have larger mean compared to the others.\n\n\ndelta\n \n=\n \n5.0\n;\n \n# value of heterosis\n\n\nunderHyb\n \n=\n \n[(\nn\n \n==\n \nA\n \n||\n \nn\n \n==\n \nB\n)\n \nfor\n \nn\n \nin\n \ntipLabels\n(\nsim1\n)]\n \n# tips under hybrid\n\n\nunderHyb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-element Array{Bool,1}:\n false\n false\n  true\n  true\n false\n false\n\n\n\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\nlength\n(\ntrait3\n)\n\n    \nunderHyb\n[\ni\n]\n \n \n(\ntrait3\n[\ni\n]\n+=\ndelta\n)\n \n# add delta to tips A and B\n\n\nend\n\n\ntrait3\n \n# changed: +5 was added by the previous loop to A and B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 16.673 \n 15.0831\n 19.4522\n 18.9712\n 16.417 \n 22.0269\n\n\n\n\n\nThe categorical variable \nunderHyb\n separates tips \"A\" and \"B\" from the others.

One way of doing measuring that is to use Pagel's lambda\n1\n transformation of the branch lengths. This model assumes a BM on a tree where the internal branches are multiplied by a factor \u03bb, while the external branches are modified so that the total height of the tree is constant. Hence, \u03bb varies between 0 (the tree has no influence on the data) and 1 (the tree is unchanged). Using the same branch length transformations, this model can be straightforwardly extended to phylogenetic networks.\n\n\nWe can illustrate this with the predictor trait we used earlier. We use the same function as before, only indicating the model we want to use:\n\n\nfitPagel\n \n=\n \nphyloNetworklm\n(\n@formula\n(\ntrait1\n \n~\n \n1\n),\n \ndat\n,\n \ntruenet\n,\n \nmodel\n=\nlambda\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it is indeed generated according to a plain BM on the phylogeny, the estimated \u03bb should be close to 1.

However, this cannot be done directly:  ancTrait3   =   ancestralStateReconstruction ( fitTrait3 )   # Throws an error !   This is because the model we used to fit the trait (a regression with one predictor and an intercept) is not compatible with the simple model of Brownian evolution that we assumed for the ancestral state reconstruction. As the predictor used is not known for ancestral states, it is not possible to reconstruct the trait for this particular model.  The only option we have is to provide the function with the predictor's ancestral states, if they are known. They are known indeed in this toy example that we generated ourselves, so we can reconstruct our trait doing the following:  ancTrait3   =   ancestralStateReconstruction ( fitTrait3 , \n               [ ones ( 7 ,   1 )   sim1 [ : InternalNodes ]   sim2 [ : InternalNodes ]])  plot ( truenet ,   nodeLabel   =   predintPlot ( ancTrait3 ))    where we provided the ancestral predictors as a matrix, containing the intercept, and the known predictor at the nodes. The user must be very careful with this function, as no check is done for the order of the predictors, that must be in the same order as the internal nodes of the phylogeny.

This means that it inherits from most of its features, and in particular, it can handle formulas with factors or interactions. For example, in lizards, we might want to do a regression of toe length against body length and the region where each species is found, where this region is coded into 4 categories (say). We might also want to include an interaction effect between body length and region. (This model has no biological basis. It is just meant to show the possibilities of the function).  To illustrate the use of categorical predictors of particular interest in a network with reticulations, let's assume that some heterosis took place after the hybridization event, so that tips \"A\" and \"B\" have larger mean compared to the others.  delta   =   5.0 ;   # value of heterosis  underHyb   =   [( n   ==   A   ||   n   ==   B )   for   n   in   tipLabels ( sim1 )]   # tips under hybrid  underHyb   6-element Array{Bool,1}:\n false\n false\n  true\n  true\n false\n false  for   i   in   1 : length ( trait3 ) \n     underHyb [ i ]     ( trait3 [ i ] += delta )   # add delta to tips A and B  end  trait3   # changed: +5 was added by the previous loop to A and B   6-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 16.673 \n 15.0831\n 19.4522\n 18.9712\n 16.417 \n 22.0269  The categorical variable  underHyb  separates tips \"A\" and \"B\" from the others.

            "text": "One classical question about trait evolution is the amount of \"phylogenetic signal\" in a dataset, that is, the importance of the tree structure to explain variation in the observed traits. One way of doing measuring that is to use Pagel's lambda 1  transformation of the branch lengths. This model assumes a BM on a tree where the internal branches are multiplied by a factor \u03bb, while the external branches are modified so that the total height of the tree is constant. Hence, \u03bb varies between 0 (the tree has no influence on the data) and 1 (the tree is unchanged). Using the same branch length transformations, this model can be straightforwardly extended to phylogenetic networks.  We can illustrate this with the predictor trait we used earlier. We use the same function as before, only indicating the model we want to use:  fitPagel   =   phyloNetworklm ( @formula ( trait1   ~   1 ),   dat ,   truenet ,   model = lambda )   As it is indeed generated according to a plain BM on the phylogeny, the estimated \u03bb should be close to 1.

All networks must be fully resolved, and on the same taxon set. If \nrooted=true\n, all networks are assumed to have been properly rooted beforehand. Otherwise, the origin of each hybrid edge is considered as an unrooted bipartition (default).\n\n\nTwo hybrid edges in two networks are said to match if they share the same \"hybrid\" clade (or recipient) and the same \"donor clade\", which is a sister to the hybrid clade in the network. Since a hybrid clade has 2 parent edges, it is sister to two clades simultaneously: one is its major sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5) and one is its minor sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5).\n\n\nTo calculate these hybrid and sister clades at a given hybrid node, all other hybrid edges are first removed from the network. Then, the hybrid clade is the hardwired cluster (descendants) of either hybrid edge and major/minor clade is the hardwired cluster of the sibling edge of the major/minor hybrid parent.

Function .  directEdges!(net::HybridNetwork; checkMajor=true::Bool)  Updates the edges' attribute  isChild1 , according to the root placement. Also updates edges' attribute  containRoot , for other possible root placements compatible with the direction of existing hybrid edges. Relies on hybrid nodes having exactly 1 major hybrid parent edge, but checks for that if checkMajor=true.  Warning: Assumes that isChild1 is correct on hybrid edges (to avoid changing the identity of which nodes are hybrids and which are not).  Returns the network. Throws a 'RootMismatch' Exception if the root was found to conflict with the direction of any hybrid edge.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.preorder!     Function .  preorder!(net::HybridNetwork)  Updates attribute net.nodes_changed in which the nodes are pre-ordered (also called topological sorting), such that each node is visited after its parent(s). The edges' direction needs to be correct before calling preorder!, using directEdges!  source  #  PhyloNetworks.cladewiseorder!     Function .  cladewiseorder!(net::HybridNetwork)  Updates attribute net.cladewiseorder_nodeIndex. Used for plotting the network. In the major tree, all nodes in a given clade are consecutive.

Function .  rootatnode !( HybridNetwork ,   nodeNumber :: Integer ;   index = false :: Bool )  rootatnode !( HybridNetwork ,   Node )  rootatnode !( HybridNetwork ,   nodeName :: AbstractString )   Roots the network/tree object at the node with name 'nodeName' or number 'nodeNumber' (by default) or with index 'nodeNumber' if index=true. Attributes isChild1 and containRoot are updated along the way. Use  plot(net, showNodeNumber=true, showEdgeLength=false)  to visualize and identify a node of interest.  Returns the network.  Warnings:   If the node is a leaf, the root will be placed along the edge adjacent to the leaf, with a message. This might add a new node.   If the desired root placement is incompatible with one or more hybrids, then   a RootMismatch error is thrown  the input network will still have some attributes modified.     See also:  rootonedge! .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.rootonedge!     Function .  rootonedge !( HybridNetwork ,   edgeNumber :: Integer ;   index = false :: Bool )  rootonedge !( HybridNetwork ,   Edge )   Roots the network/tree object along an edge with number 'edgeNumber' (by default) or with index 'edgeNumber if index=true. Attributes isChild1 and containRoot are updated along the way.  This adds a new node and a new edge to the network. Use  plot(net, showEdgeNumber=true, showEdgeLength=false)  to visualize and identify an edge of interest.  See also:  rootatnode! .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.hybridatnode!     Function .  hybridatnode!(net::HybridNetwork, nodeNumber::Integer)  Changes the hybrid in a cycle to the node with number  nodeNumber . This node must be in one (and only one) cycle, otherwise an error will be thrown.  Example #\"  julia   net   =   readTopology ( (A:1.0,((B:1.1,#H1:0.2::0.2):1.2,(((C:0.52,(E:0.5)#H2:0.02::0.7):0.6,(#H2:0.01::0.3,F:0.7):0.8):0.9,(D:0.8)#H1:0.3::0.8):1.3):0.7):0.1; );  julia   plot ( net ,   showNodeNumber = true )  julia   hybridatnode!

For example, if you have a HybridNetwork object net, and do printEdges(net), you can see the list of Edges and their lengths. You can then change the length of the 3rd edge with setLength!(net.edge[3],1.2). If  new length  is above 10, the value 10 will be used, as an upper limit to coalescent units that can be reliably estimated.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.setGamma!     Function .  setGamma!(Edge,new gamma)  set \u03b3 for an edge, which must be a hybrid edge. The new \u03b3 needs to be in (0,1). The \u03b3 of the sister hybrid edge is changed accordingly, to 1-\u03b3. If  net  is a HybridNetwork object,  printEdges(net)  will show the list of edges and their \u03b3's. The \u03b3 of the third hybrid edge (say) can be changed to 0.2 with  setGamma!(net.edge[3],0.2) . This will automatically set \u03b3 of the sister hybrid edge to 0.8.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.deleteleaf!     Function .  deleteleaf !( HybridNetwork ,   leafName :: AbstractString ;   simplify = true )  deleteleaf !( HybridNetwork ,   Node ;   simplify = true )  deleteleaf !( HybridNetwork ,   Integer ;   index = false ,   simplify = true )   Deletes a leaf node from the network, possibly from its name, number, or index in the network's array of nodes.  simplify: if true and if deleting the node results in 2 hybrid edges forming a cycle of k=2 nodes, then these hybrid edges are merged and simplified as a single tree edge.  The first 2 versions require that  node  is a leaf. The 3rd version does  not  require that  node  is a leaf. If  node  has degree 3 or more, nothing happens. If it has degree 1 or 2, it is deleted.  Warning: does  not  update attributes related to level-1 networks, such as inCycle, partition, gammaz, etc. Does not require branch lengths, and designed to work on networks of all levels.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.deleteHybridThreshold!     Function .  deleteHybridThreshold!(net::HybridNetwork,gamma::Float64)  Deletes from a network all hybrid edges with heritability below a threshold gamma. Returns the network.   if gamma 0.5: deletes     minor hybrid edges with gamma value    threshold  if gamma=0.5: deletes all minor hybrid edges (i.e gamma value  = threshold)   Warning: assumes correct isMajor attributes.  source  #  Gadfly.plot     Function .       function   plot ( data_source :: @ compat ( Union { AbstractMatrix ,   AbstractDataFrame } ), \n               elements :: ElementOrFunctionOrLayers ...;   mapping ...)   Create a new plot.  Grammar of graphics style plotting consists of specifying a dataset, one or more plot elements (scales, coordinates, geometries, etc), and binding of aesthetics to columns or expressions of the dataset.  For example, a simple scatter plot would look something like:  plot(my_data, Geom.point, x=\"time\", y=\"price\")  Where \"time\" and \"price\" are the names of columns in my_data.  Args:   data_source: Data to be bound to aesthetics.  elements: Geometries, statistics, etc.  mapping: Aesthetics symbols (e.g. :x, :y, :color) mapped to names of columns in the data frame or other expressions.   source  function   plot ( data_source :: @compat ( Union {( @compat   Void ),   AbstractMatrix ,   AbstractDataFrame }), \n               mapping :: Dict ,   elements :: ElementOrFunctionOrLayers ...)   The old fashioned (pre named arguments) version of plot.  This version takes an explicit mapping dictionary, mapping aesthetics symbols to expressions or columns in the data frame.  Args:   data_source: Data to be bound to aesthetics.  mapping: Dictionary of aesthetics symbols (e.g. :x, :y, :color) to           names of columns in the data frame or other expressions.  elements: Geometries, statistics, etc.   Returns:  A Plot object.  source  plot ( net :: HybridNetwork ;   useEdgeLength = false ,   mainTree = false ,   showTipLabel = true , \n      showNodeNumber = false ,   showEdgeLength = false ,   showGamma = false ,   edgeColor = colorant black , \n      majorHybridEdgeColor = colorant deepskyblue4 ,   minorHybridEdgeColor = colorant deepskyblue , \n      showEdgeNumber = false ,   showIntNodeLabel = false ,   edgeLabel = [] ,   nodeLabel = [] )   Plots a network, from left to right.   useEdgeLength: if true, the tree edges and major hybrid edges are drawn proportionally to their length. Minor hybrid edges are not, however. Note that edge lengths in coalescent units may scale very poorly with time.  mainTree: if true, the minor hybrid edges are ommitted.  showTipLabel: if true, taxon labels are shown. You may need to zoom out to see them.  showNodeNumber: if true, nodes are labelled with the number used internally.  showEdgeLength: if true, edges are labelled with their length (above)  showGamma: if true, hybrid edges are labelled with their heritability (below)  edgeColor: color for tree edges. black by default.  majorHybridEdgeColor: color for major hybrid edges  minorHybridEdgeColor: color for minor hybrid edges  showEdgeNumber: if true, edges are labelled with the number used internally.  showIntNodeLabel: if true, internal nodes are labelled with their names. Useful for hybrid nodes, which do have tags like '#H1'.  edgeLabel: dataframe with two columns: the first with edge numbers, the second with labels (like bootstrap values) to annotate edges. empty by default.  nodeLabel: dataframe with two columns: the first with node numbers, the second with labels (like bootstrap values for hybrid relationships) to annotate nodes. empty by default.   Note that  plot  actually modifies some (minor) attributes of the network, as it calls  directEdges! ,  preorder!  and  cladewiseorder! .  If hybrid edges cross tree and major edges, you may choose to rotate some tree edges to eliminate crossing edges, using  rotate! .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.rotate!     Function .  rotate!(net::HybridNetwork, nodeNumber::Integer; orderedEdgeNum::Array{Int,1})  Rotates the order of the node's children edges. Useful for plotting, to remove crossing edges. If  node  is a tree node with no polytomy, the 2 children edges are switched and the optional argument  orderedEdgeNum  is ignored.  Use plot(net, showNodeNumber=true, showEdgeNumber=false) to map node and edge numbers on the network, as shown in the examples below.  Warning: assumes that edges are correctly directed (isChild1 updated). This is done by plot(net). Otherwise run directEdges!(net).

It sets any missing branch length to 1.0.  If the network has a bad diamond II (in which edge lengths are \u03b3's are not identifiable) and if the edge below this diamond has a length  t  different from 0, then this length is set back to 0 and the major parent hybrid edge is lengthened by  t .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.readInputTrees     Function .  readInputTrees(file)  function to read a text file with a list of trees in parenthetical format (one tree per line), it returns an array of HybridNetwork object.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.readMultiTopology     Function .  readMultiTopology(file)  Read a text file with a list of networks in parenthetical format (one per line).

The first 4 columns are assumed to give the labels of the 4 taxa in each set (tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4). Columns containing the CFs are assumed to be named 'CF12_34', 'CF13_24' and 'CF14_23', or else are assumed to be columns 5,6,7. If present, a column named 'ngenes' will be used to get the number of loci used to estimate the CFs for each 4-taxon set.  Optional arguments:   summaryfile: if specified, a summary file will be created with that name.  sep (for the first form only): to specify the type of separator in the file, with single quotes: sep=';'. Default is a  csv  file, i.e.  sep=',' .   The last version modifies the input data frame, if species are represented by multiple alleles for instance (see  readTableCF! ).  source  #  PhyloNetworks.readTableCF!     Function .  readTableCF!(data frame, columns)  Read in quartet CFs from data frame, assuming information is in columns numbered  columns , of length  7 or 8 : 4 taxon labels then 3 CFs then ngenes possibly.  If some species appears more than once in the same 4-taxon set (e.g. t1,t1,t2,t3), then the data frame is modified to remove rows (4-taxon sets) that are uninformative about between-species relationships. This situation may occur if multiple individuals are sampled from the same species. A 4-taxon set is uninformative (and its row is removed) if one taxon is repeated 3 or 4 times (like t1,t1,t1,t1 or t1,t2,t2,t2). The list of species appearing twice in some 4-taxon sets is stored in the output DataCF object. For these species, the length of their external edge is identifiable (in coalescent units). If multiple rows correspond to the same 4-taxon set, these rows are merged and their CF values (and number of genes) are averaged.  readTableCF!(DataCF, data frame, columns)  Modify the  .quartet.obsCF  values in the  DataCF  object with those read from the data frame in columns numbered  columns .  columns  should have  3  columns numbers for the 3 CFs in this order: 12_34, 13_24 and 14_23.

The following optional arguments control when to stop proposing new network topologies:   Nfail (75): maximum number of times that new topologies are proposed and rejected (in a row).  liktolAbs (1e-6): the proposed network is accepted if its score is better than the current score by at least liktolAbs.   Lower values of Nfail and greater values of liktolAbs and ftolAbs would result in a less thorough but faster search.  At the end, branch lengths and \u03b3's are optimized on the last \"best\" network with different and very thorough tolerance parameters: 1e-12 for ftolRel, 1e-10 for ftolAbs, xtolRel, xtolAbs.  See also:  topologyMaxQPseudolik!  to optimize parameters on a fixed topology, and  topologyQPseudolik!  to get the deviance (pseudo log-likelihood up to a constant) of a fixed topology with fixed parameters.

Function .  topologyMaxQPseudolik!(net::HybridNetwork, d::DataCF)  Estimate the branch lengths and inheritance probabilities (\u03b3's) for a given network topology. The network is  not  modified, only the object  d  is, with updated expected concordance factors.  Ouput: new network, with optimized parameters (branch lengths and gammas). The maximized quartet pseudo-deviance is the negative log pseudo-likelihood, up to an additive constant, such that a perfect fit corresponds to a deviance of 0.0. This is also an attribute of the network, which can be accessed with  net.loglik .  Optional arguments (default value):   verbose (false): if true, information on the numerical optimization is printed to screen  ftolRel (1e-5), ftolAbs (1e-6), xtolRel (1e-3), xtolAbs (1e-4): absolute and relative tolerance values for the pseudo-deviance function and the parameters   source  #  PhyloNetworks.topologyQPseudolik!     Function .  topologyQPseudolik!(net::HybridNetwork, d::DataCF)  Calculate the quartet pseudo-deviance of a given network/tree for DataCF  d . This is the negative log pseudo-likelihood, up to an additive constant, such that a perfect fit corresponds to a deviance of 0.0.  Be careful if the net object does not have all internal branch lengths specified because then the pseudolikelihood will be meaningless.  The loglik attribute of the network is undated, and  d  is updated with the expected concordance factors under the input network.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.fittedQuartetCF     Function .  fittedQuartetCF(d::DataCF, format::Symbol)  return a data frame with the observed and expected quartet concordance factors after estimation of a network with snaq(T,d). The format can be :wide (default) or :long.   if wide, the output has one row per 4-taxon set, and each row has 10 columns: 4 columns for the taxon names, 3 columns for the observed CFs and 3 columns for the expected CF.  if long, the output has one row per quartet, i.e. 3 rows per 4-taxon sets, and 7 columns: 4 columns for the taxon names, one column to give the quartet resolution, one column for the observed CF and the last column for the expected CF.   see also:  topologyQPseudolik!  and  topologyMaxQPseudolik!  to update the fitted CF expected under a specific network, inside the DataCF object  d .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.bootsnaq     Function .  bootsnaq(T::HybridNetwork, df::DataFrame)\nbootsnaq(T::HybridNetwork, vector of tree lists)  Bootstrap analysis for SNaQ. Bootstrap data can be quartet concordance factors (CF), drawn from sampling uniformly in their credibility intervals, as given in the data frame  df . Alternatively, bootstrap data can be gene trees sampled from a vector of tree lists: one list of bootstrap trees per locus (see  readBootstrapTrees  to generate this, from a file containing a list of bootstrap files: one per locus).  From each bootstrap replicate, a network is estimated with snaq!, with a search starting from topology  T . Optional arguments include the following, with default values in parentheses:   hmax (1): max number of reticulations in the estimated networks  nrep (10): number of bootstrap replicates.  runs (10): number of independent optimization runs for each replicate  filename (\"bootsnaq\"): root name for output files. No output files if \"\".  seed (0 to get a random seed from the clock): seed for random number generator  otherNet (empty): another starting topology so that each replicate will start prcnet% runs on otherNet and (1-prcnet)% runs on T  prcnet (0): percentage of runs starting on otherNet; error if different than 0.0, and otherNet not specified.  ftolRel, ftolAbs, xtolRel, xtolAbs, liktolAbs, Nfail: see  snaq! , same defaults.   source",

Warnings: Clusters are rooted, so the root must be correct.           Allows for missing taxa, with entries all 0.  Each row corresponds to one internal edge, that is, external edges are excluded. If the root is a leaf node, the external edge to that leaf is included (first row). Both parent hybrid edges to a given hybrid node only contribute a single row (they share the same hardwired cluster).   first column: edge number  next columns: 0/1 values. 1=descendant of edge, 0=not a descendant, or missing taxon.  last column:  10/11 values. 10=tree edge, 11=hybrid edge   source  #  PhyloNetworks.hardwiredCluster     Function .  hardwiredCluster(edge::Edge,taxa::Union{Vector{String},Vector{Int}})\nhardwiredCluster!(v::Vector{Bool},edge::Edge,taxa::Union{Vector{String},Vector{Int}})\nhardwiredCluster!(v::Vector{Bool},edge::Edge,taxa::Union{Vector{String},Vector{Int}},\n                  visited::Vector{Int})  Calculate the hardwired cluster of  node , coded a vector of booleans: true for taxa that are descendent of nodes, false for other taxa (including missing taxa).  The node should belong in a rooted network for which isChild1 is up-to-date. Run directEdges! beforehand. This is very important, otherwise one might enter an infinite loop, and the function does not test for this.  visited: vector of node numbers, of all visited nodes.

Note that this is not a distance per se on the full space of hybrid networks: there are pairs of different networks for which this measure is 0. But it is a distance on some network subspaces.  If the 2 networks are trees, this is the Robinson-Foulds distance. If rooted=false, the trees are considered unrooted.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.treeEdgesBootstrap     Function .  treeEdgesBootstrap(boot_net::Vector{HybridNetwork}, ref_net::HybridNetwork)  read a list of bootstrap networks ( boot_net ) and a reference network ( ref_net ), and calculate the bootstrap support of the tree edges in the reference network. All minor hybrid edges (\u03b3 0.5) are removed to extract the major tree from each network. All remaining edges are tree edges, each associated with a bipartition.  output:   a data frame with one row per tree edge and two columns: edge number, bootstrap support (as a percentage)  the major tree from the reference network, where minor hybrid edges (with \u03b3 0.5) have been removed.   source  #  PhyloNetworks.hybridBootstrapSupport     Function .  hybridBootstrapSupport(boot_net::Vector{HybridNetwork}, ref_net::HybridNetwork; rooted=false)  Match hybrid nodes in a reference network with those in an array of networks, like bootstrap networks. All networks must be fully resolved, and on the same taxon set. If  rooted=true , all networks are assumed to have been properly rooted beforehand. Otherwise, the origin of each hybrid edge is considered as an unrooted bipartition (default).  Two hybrid edges in two networks are said to match if they share the same \"hybrid\" clade (or recipient) and the same \"donor clade\", which is a sister to the hybrid clade in the network. Since a hybrid clade has 2 parent edges, it is sister to two clades simultaneously: one is its major sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3 0.5) and one is its minor sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3 0.5).  To calculate these hybrid and sister clades at a given hybrid node, all other hybrid edges are first removed from the network. Then, the hybrid clade is the hardwired cluster (descendants) of either hybrid edge and major/minor clade is the hardwired cluster of the sibling edge of the major/minor hybrid parent. If  rooted=false , sister clades are considered as bipartitions.  Output:   a \"node\" data frame (see below)  an \"edge\" data frame (see below)  a \"clade\" data frame to describe the make up of all clades found as hybrids or sisters,   starting with a column  taxa  that lists all taxa. All other columns correspond to a given   clade and contain true/false values.  true  means that a given taxon belongs in a given clade.   For a clade named  H1 , for instance, and if the data frame was named  cla , the   list of taxa in this clade can be obtained with  cla[:taxa][cla[:H1]] .   an array of gamma values, with one row for each bootstrap network and two columns (major/minor)   for each hybrid edge in the reference network. If this hybrid edge was found in the bootstrap network   (i.e. same hybrid and sister clades, after removal of all other hybrid nodes),   its bootstrap gamma value is recorded here. Otherwise, the gamma entry is 0.0.   a vector with the number of each hybrid edge in the reference network, in the same order   as for the columns in the array of gamma values above.  The \"node\" data frame has one row per clade and 9 columns giving:   clade : the clade's name, like the taxon name (if a hybrid is a single taxon) or the hybrid tag (like 'H1') in the reference network  node : the node number in the reference network. NA if the clade is not in this network.  hybridnode : typically the same node number as above, except for hybrid clades in the reference network. For those, the hybrid node number is listed here.  edge : number of the parent edge, parent to the node in column 2, if found in the ref network. NA otherwise.  BS_hybrid : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be a hybrid clade.  BS_sister : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be sister to some hybrid clade (sum of the next 2 columns)  BS_major_sister : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be the major sister to some hybrid clade  BS_minor_sister : same as previous, but minor  BS_hybrid_samesisters : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be a hybrid and with the same set of sister clades as in the reference network. Applies to hybrid clades found in the reference network only, NA for all other clades.   The \"edge\" data frame has one row for each pair of clades, and 8 columns:   edge : hybrid edge number, if the edge appears in the reference network. NA otherwise.  hybrid_clade : name of the clade found to be a hybrid, descendent of 'edge'  hybrid : node number of that clade, if it appears in the reference network. NA otherwise.  sister_clade : name of the clade that is sister to 'edge', i.e. be sister to a hybrid  sister : node number of that clade, if in the ref network.  BS_hybrid_edge : percentage of bootstrap networks in which 'edge' is found to be a hybrid  edge, i.e. when the clade in the 'hybrid' column is found to be a hybrid and the clade in  the 'sister' column is one of its sisters.  BS_major : percentage of bootstrap networks in which 'edge' is found to be a major hybrid  edge, i.e. when 'hybrid' is found to be a hybrid clade and 'sister' is found to be its  major sister.

For example, if \ncurrT\n is a tree, we cannot propose move origin/target.\n\n\nmove = whichMove\n selects randomly a type of move, depending on \nNmov,movesfail,hmax,newT\n with weights 1/5 by default for all, and 0 for delete.

If \nnewT.numHybrids\n is far from \nhmax\n, we give higher probability to adding a new hybrid (we want to reach the \nhmax\n sooner, maybe not the best strategy, easy to change).  Later, we adjust the weights by \nmovesfail\n (first, give weight of 0 if \nmovesfail[i]\nNmov[i]\n, that is, if we reached the maximum possible number of moves allowed for a certain type) and then increase the probability of the other moves.

The function cannot choose an external edge. it will update locally the attributes.\n\n\n Important: \n All the moves undo what they did if the move was not successful, so at the end you either have a \nnewT\n with a new move and with all good attributes, or the same \nnewT\n that started. This is important to avoid having to do deepcopy of the network before doing the move. Also, after each move, when we update the attributes, we do not update the attributes of the whole network, we only update the attributes of the edges that were affected by the move. This saves time, but makes the code quite clunky. Only the case of multiple alleles the moves does not undo what it did, because it finds out that it failed after the function is over, so just need to treat this case special.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nPhyloNetworks.optBL!\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\noptBL\n road map\n\n\nFunction that optimizes the numerical parameters (branch lengths and inheritance probabilities) for a given network.

Hybrid nodes with an empty  name  field (\"\") are modified with a name that does not conflict with other hybrid names in the network. The preferred name is \"#H3\" if the node number is 3 or -3, but an index other than 3 would be used if \"#H3\" were the name of another hybrid node already.  If two hybrid nodes have non-empty and equal names, the name of one of them is changed and re-assigned as described above (with a warning).  source  #  PhyloNetworks.deleteNode!     Function .  deleteNode!(net::HybridNetwork, n::Node)  deletes a Node from a network, i.e. removes it from net.node, and from net.hybrid or net.leaf as appropriate. Updates attributes numNodes, numTaxa, numHybrids (it does not update net.names though).  Warning: if the root is deleted, the new root is arbitrarily set to the first node in the list. This is intentional to save time because this function is used frequently in snaq!, which handles semi-directed (unrooted) networks.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.sampleBootstrapTrees     Function .  sampleBootstrapTrees(vector of tree lists; seed=0::Integer, generesampling=false, row=0)\nsampleBootstrapTrees!(tree list, vector of tree lists; seed=0::Integer, generesampling=false, row=0)  Sample bootstrap gene trees, 1 tree per gene. Set the seed with keyword argument  seed , which is 0 by default. When  seed=0 , the actual seed is set using the clock. Assumes a vector of vectors of networks (see  readBootstrapTrees ), each one of length 1 or more (error if one vector is empty, tested in  bootsnaq ).   site resampling: always, from sampling one bootstrap tree from each given list.

The non-modifying function creates a new data frame (with re-ordered columns) and returns it. If  seed=-1 , the new df is a deep copy of the input df, with no call to the random number generator. Otherwise,  seed  is passed to the modifying function.  The modifying function overwrites the input data frame with the sampled CFs and returns it. If  seed=0 , the random generator is seeded from the clock. Otherwise the random generator is seeded using  seed .   Warning: the modifying version does  not  check the df: assumes correct columns.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.setNonIdBL!

Road map for various functions behind snaq!  snaq!\noptTopRuns!\noptTopRun1!\noptTopLevel!\noptBL!\nsnaqDebug  All return their optimized network.   snaq! calls optTopRuns! once, after a deep copy of the starting network. If the data contain multiple alleles from a given species,  snaq!  first expands the leaf for that species into 2 separate leaves, and merges them back into a single leaf after calling  optTopRuns! .  optTopRuns! calls optTopRun1! several (nrun) times. assumes level-1 network with  0 branch lengths. assumes same tips in network as in data: i.e. 2 separate tips per species                                          that has multiple alleles. each call to optTopRun1! gets the same starting network.  optTopRun1! calls optTopLevel! once, after deep copying + changing the starting network slightly.  optTopLevel! calls optBL! various times and proposes new network with various moves.  snaqDebug calls optTopRun1! once   Functions that are no longer used, and not tested as much:  optTop! : optimizes at h=0, then h=1 etc.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.optTopRun1!     Function .  optTopRun1  roadmap  The function will run 1 run by modifying the starting topology and calling  optTopLevel .   probST  (default in snaq is 0.3) is the probability of starting one run in the same starting tree. So, with probability  1-probST , we will change the topology by a NNI move on a tree edge without neighbor hybrid.   If the starting topology is a network, then with probability  1-probST  it will modify one randomly chosen hybrid edge: with prob 0.5, the function will move origin, with prob 0.5 will do move target  If there are multiple alleles ( d.repSpecies  not empty), then the function has to check that the starting topology does not violate the multiple alleles condition.  After modifying the starting topology with NNI and/or move origin/target, the function calls  optTopLevel .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.optTopLevel!     Function .  optTopLevel  road map  Function that does most of the heavy-lifting of  snaq . It optimizes the pseudolikelihood for a given starting topology, and returns the best network. Assumes that the starting topology is level-1 network, and has all the attributes correctly updated.  Input parameters:   Starting topology  currT , input data  DataCF   d , maximum number of hybridizations  hmax  Numerical optimization parameters:  liktolAbs, Nfail, ftolRel, ftolAbs, xtolRel, xtolAbs  Print parameters:  verbose, sout, logfile, writelog  Parameters to tune the search in space of networks:  closeN=true  only propose move origin/target to neighbor edges (coded, but not tested with  closeN=false ),  Nmov0  vector with maximum number of trials allowed per type of move  (add, mvorigin, mvtarget, chdir, delete, nni) , by default computed inside with coupon\u2019s collector formulas   The optimization procedure keeps track of   movescount : count of proposed moves,  movesgamma : count of proposed moves to fix a gamma zero situation (see below for definition of this situation),  movesfail : count of failed moves by violation of level-1 network ( inCycle  attribute) or worse pseudolikelihood than current,  failures : number of failed proposals that had a worse pseudolikelihood   Optimization procedure:  While the difference between current loglik and proposed loglik is greater than  liktolAbs , or  failures Nfail , or  stillmoves=true :   Nmov  is updated based on  newT . The type of move proposed will depend on  newT  (which is the same as  currT  at this point). For example, if  currT  is a tree, we cannot propose move origin/target.  move = whichMove  selects randomly a type of move, depending on  Nmov,movesfail,hmax,newT  with weights 1/5 by default for all, and 0 for delete. These weights are adjusted depending on  newT.numHybrids  and  hmax . If  newT.numHybrids  is far from  hmax , we give higher probability to adding a new hybrid (we want to reach the  hmax  sooner, maybe not the best strategy, easy to change).  Later, we adjust the weights by  movesfail  (first, give weight of 0 if  movesfail[i] Nmov[i] , that is, if we reached the maximum possible number of moves allowed for a certain type) and then increase the probability of the other moves.  So, unless one move has  w=0 , nothing changes. This could be improved by using the outlier quartets to guide the proposal of moves.  whichMove  will choose a move randomly from the weights, it will return  none  if no more moves allowed, in which case, the optimization ends   flag=proposedTop!(move, newT)  will modify  newT  based on  move . The function  proposedTop  will return  flag=true  if the move was successful (the move succeeded by  inCycle ,  containRoot , available edge to make the move (more details in  proposedTop )). If  flag=false , then  newT  is cleaned, except for the case of multiple alleles. The function  proposedTop  keeps count of  movescount  (successful move),  movesfail  (unsuccessful move),  Options:  random=true : moves major/minor hybrid edge with prob h,1-h, respectively  N=10 : number of trials for NNI edge.\n  * if(flag) Optimize branch lengths with  optBL  If  newT.loglik  is better than  currT.loglik  by  liktolAbs , jump to  newT  ( accepted=true ) and fix  gamma=0, t=0  problems (more info on  afterOptBL )  If(accepted)    failures=0 ,  movesfail=zeros ,  movescount  for successful move +1    end while  After choosing the best network  newT , we do one last more thorough optimization of branch lengths with  optBL , we change non identifiable branch lengths to -1 and return  newT  source  #  PhyloNetworks.proposedTop!     Function .  proposedTop!(move,newT,random,count,N,movescount,movesfail,multall)  road map  Function to change the current network  newT  by a given  move , and checks that the move was successful (correct attributes). If not successful,  newT  is changed back to its original state, except for the case of multiple alleles.  Note  that the update of attributes by each move is not done in all the network, but only in the local edges that were changed by the move. This is efficient (and makes a move easy to undo), but makes the code of each move function very clunky.  Arguments:   move chosen from  whichMove  as described in  optTopLevel  newT  is the topology that will be modified inside with the move  random=true : chooses minor hybrid edge with prob 1-h, and major edge with prob h, if false, always chooses minor hybrid edge  count : simply which likelihood step we are in in the optimization at  optTopLevel  movescount  and  movesfail : vector of counts of number of moves proposed  multall=true  if multiple alleles case: we need to check if the move did not violate the multiple alleles condition (sister alleles together and no gene flow into the alleles). This is inefficient because we are proposing moves that we can reject later, instead of being smart about the moves we propose: for example, move origin/target could rule out some neighbors that move gene flow into the alleles, the same for add hybridization; nni move can check if it is trying to separate the alleles)   Moves:   addHybridizationUpdate(newT,N) :   will choose a partition first (to avoid choosing edges that will create a non level-1 network) will choose two edges from this partition randomly, will not allow two edges in a cherry (non-identifiable), or sister edges that are not identifiable (the blacklist was a way to keep track of \"bad edges\" were we should not waste time trying to put hybridizations, it has never been used nor tested). Also choose gamma from U(0,0.5). The \"Update\" in the function name means that it creates the new hybrid, and also updates all the attributes of  newT   node = chooseHybrid(newT)  choose a hybrid randomly for the next moves:  moveOriginUpdateRepeat!(newT,node,random)   will choose randomly the minor/major hybrid edge to move (if  random=true ); will get the list of all neighbor edges where to move the origin, will move the origin and update all the attributes and check if the move was successful (not conflicting attributes); if not, will undo the move, and try with a different neighbor until it runs out of neighbors. Return true if the move was successful.   moveTargetUpdateRepeat!(newT,node,random)   same as move origin but moving the target   changeDirectionUpdate!(newT,node,random)   chooses minor/major hybrid edge at random (if `random=true), and changes the direction, and updates all the attributes. Checks if the move was successful (returns true), or undoes the change and returns false.   deleteHybridizationUpdate!(newT,node)   removes the hybrid node, updates the attributes, no need to check any attributes, always successful move   NNIRepeat!(newT,N)   choose an edge for nni that does not have a neighbor hybrid. It will try to find such an edge N times, and if it fails, it will return false (unsuccessful move). N=10 by default. If N=1, it rarely finds such an edge if the network is small or complex. The function cannot choose an external edge. it will update locally the attributes.   Important:   All the moves undo what they did if the move was not successful, so at the end you either have a  newT  with a new move and with all good attributes, or the same  newT  that started. This is important to avoid having to do deepcopy of the network before doing the move. Also, after each move, when we update the attributes, we do not update the attributes of the whole network, we only update the attributes of the edges that were affected by the move. This saves time, but makes the code quite clunky. Only the case of multiple alleles the moves does not undo what it did, because it finds out that it failed after the function is over, so just need to treat this case special.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.optBL!     Function .  optBL  road map  Function that optimizes the numerical parameters (branch lengths and inheritance probabilities) for a given network. This function is called multiple times inside  optTopLevel! .   Input: network  net , data  d  Numerical tolerances:  ftolAbs, ftolRel, xtolAbs, xtolRel  Function based on  MixedModels   fit  function  The function assumes  net  has all the right attributes, and cannot check this inside because it would be inefficient   Procedure:   ht = parameters!(net)  extracts the vector of parameters to estimate  (h,t,gammaz) , and sets as  net.ht ; identifies a bad diamond I, sets  net.numht  (vector of hybrid node numbers for h, edge numbers for t, hybrid node numbers for gammaz), and  net.index  to keep track of the vector of parameters to estimate   extractQuartet!(net,d)  does the following for all quartets in  d.quartet :   Extract quartet by deleting all leaves not in q -  create  QuartetNetwork  object saved in  q.qnet  This network is ugly and does not have edges collapsed. This is done to keep a one-to-one correspondence between the edges in  q.qnet  and the edges in  net  (if we remove nodes with only two edges, we will lose this correspondence)  Calculate expected CF with  calculateExpCFAll  for a copy of  q.qnet . We do this copy because we want to keep  q.qnet  as it is (without collapsed edges into one). The function will then save the  expCF  in  q.qnet.expCF   calculateExpCFAll!(qnet)  will    identify the type of quartet as type 1 (equivalent to a tree) or type 2 (minor CF different). Here the code will first clean up any hybrid node by removing nodes with only two edges before identifying the  qnet  (because identification depends on neighbor nodes to hybrid node); later, set  qnet.which  (1 or 2),  node.prev  (neighbor node to hybrid node), updates  node.k  (number of nodes in hybridization cycle, this can change after deleting the nodes with only two edges),  node.typeHyb  (1,2,3,4,5 depending on the number of nodes in the hybridization cycle and the origin/target of the minor hybrid edge; this attribute is never used).   eliminate hybridization: this will remove type 1 hybridizations first. If  qnet.which=1 , then the  qnet  is similar to a tree quartet, so it will calculate the internal length of the tree quartet:  qnet.t1 .  update split for  qnet.which=1 , to determine which taxa are together. For example, for the quartet 12|34, the split is  1,1,2,2 , that is, taxon 1 and 2 are on the same side of the split. This will update  qnet.split  update formula for  qnet.which=1  to know the order of minorCF and majorCF in the vector  qnet.expCF . That is, if the quartet is 1342 (order in  qnet.quartet.taxon ), then the expected CF should match the observed CF in 13|42, 14|32, 12|34 and the  qnet  is 12|34 (given by  qnet.split ),  qnet.formula  will be [2,2,1] minor, minor, major  calculateExpCF!(qnet)  for  qnet.which=1 , it will do  1-2/3exp(-qnet.t1)  if  qnet.formula[i]==1 , and  1/3exp(qnet.t1)  if  qnet.formula[i]==2 . For  qnet.which=2 , we need to make sure that there is only one hybrid node, and compute the major, minor1,minor2 expected CF in the order 12|34, 13|24, 14|23 of the taxa in  qnet.quartet.taxon     Then we create a  NLopt  object with algorithm BOBYQA and k parameters (length of ht). We define upper and lower bounds and define the objective function that should only depend on  x=(h,t,gz)  and g (gradient, which we do not have, but still need to put as argument).  The objective function  obj(x,g)  calls    calculateExpCFAll!(d,x,net)  needs to be run after  extractQuartet(net,d)  that will update  q.qnet  for all quartet.  Assumes that  qnet.indexht  is updated already: we only need to do this at the beginning of  optBL!  because the topology is fixed at this point)   First it will update the edge lengths according to x  If the  q.qnet.changed=true  (that is, any of  qnet  branches changed value), we need to call  calculateExpCFAll!(qnet)  on a copy of  q.qnet  (again because we want to leave  q.qnet  with the edge correspondence to  net )  update!(net,x)  simply saves the new x in  net.ht     Finally, we call  NLopt.optimize , and we update the  net.loglik  and  net.ht  at the end. After  optBL , we want to call  afterOptBLAll  (or  afterOptBLAllMultipleAlleles ) to check if there are  h==0,1 ;  t==0 ;  hz==0,1 .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.afterOptBL!     Function .  afterOptBL  road map  Function that will check if there are  h==0,1;t==0,hz==0,1  cases in a network after calling  optBL! .  Arguments:   closeN=true  will move origin/target, if false, add/delete N times before giving up (we have only tested  closeN=true )  origin=true  will move origin, false will move target. We added this to avoid going back and forth between the same networks  movesgamma  vector of counts of number of times each move is proposed to fix a gamma zero problem:  (add,mvorigin,mvtarget,chdir,delete,nni)   Procedure:   First we split the  ht  vector in  nh,nt,nhz  (gammas, lengths, gammaz)   If we find a  h==0,1 , we loop through  nh  to find a hybrid edge with h==0 or 1 and want to try to fix this by doing:   gammaZero!(currT,d,edge,closeN,origin,N,movesgamma)  which returns true if there was a successful change, and we stop the loop  If we find a  t==0 , we loop through all  nt  to find such edge, and do NNI move on this edge; return true if change successful and we stop the loop  If we find a  hz==0,1 , we loop through  nhz  to find such hybrid edge and call  gammaZero  again  If we did a successful change, we run  optBL  again, and recheck if there are no more problems.  Returns successchange, flagh, flagt,flaghz (flag=true means no problems)  If it is the multiple alleles case, it will not try to fix  h==0,1;hz==0,1  because it can reach a case that violates the multiple alleles condition. If we add a check here, things become horribly slow and inefficient, so we just delete a hybridization that has  h==0,1;hz==0,1      Important:    afterOptBL  is doing only one change, but we need to repeat multiple times to be sure that we fix all the gamma zero problems, which is why we call  afterOptBLRepeat  source  #  PhyloNetworks.gammaZero!     Function .  gammaZero  road map  Function that tries to fix a gamma zero problem ( h==0,1; t==0; hz==0,1 )   First tries to do  changeDirection  If not successful from start, we call  moveHybrid  If successful move (change direction), we call  optBL  and check if we fixed the problem  If problem fixed and we do not have worse pseudolik, we return  success=true  If still problem or worse pseudolik, we call  moveHybrid    Important:   Any function ( afterOptBL ) calling  gammaZero  is assuming that it only made a change, so if the returned value is true, then a change was made, and the other function needs to run  optBL  and check that all parameters are 'valid'. If the returned value is false, then no change was possible and we need to remove a hybridization if the problem is h==0,1; hz==0,1. If the problem is t==0, we ignore this problem.  source  #  PhyloNetworks.moveHybrid!     Function .  moveHybrid  road map  Function that tries to fix a gamma zero problem ( h==0,1; t==0; hz==0,1 ) after changing direction of hybrid edge failed. This function is called in  gammaZero .  Arguments:   closeN=true  will try move origin/target on all neighbors (first choose minor/major edge at random, then make list of all neighbor edges and tries to put the hybrid node in all the neighbors until successful move); if false, will delete and add hybrid until successful move up to N times (this is never tested)   Returns true if change was successful (not testing  optBL  again), and false if we could not move anything  source  #  PhyloNetworks.afterOptBLRepeat!     Function .  afterOptBLRepeat  road map  afterOptBL  is doing only one change, but we need to repeat multiple times to be sure that we fix all the gamma zero problems, which is why we call  afterOptBLRepeat . This function will repeat  afterOptBL  every time a successful change happened; this is done only if  closeN=false , because we would delete/add hybridizations and need to stop after tried N times. If  closeN=true  (default), then  afterOptBLRepeat  only does one  afterOptBL , because in this case, only the neighbor edges need to be tested, and this would have been done already in  gammaZero .  source  #  PhyloNetworks.afterOptBLAll!     Function .  afterOptBLAll  road map  After  optBL , we want to call  afterOptBLAll  (or  afterOptBLAllMultipleAlleles ) to check if there are  h==0,1 ;  t==0 ;  hz==0,1 . This function will try to fix the gamma zero problem, but if it cannot, it will call  moveDownLevel , to delete the hybridization from the network.  Procedure:  While  startover=true  and  tries N    While  badliks   N2  (number of bad pseudolikelihoods are less than  N2 )   Run  success = afterOptBLRepeat   If  success = true  (it changed something):   If worse pseudolik, then go back to original topology  currT , set  startover=true  and  badliks++   If better pseudolik, then check flags. If all good, then  startover=false ; otherwise  startover = true   If  success = false  (nothing changed), then set  badliks=N2+1  (to end the while on  currT )     If all flags are ok, then  startover = false   If bad h or hz, then call  moveDownLevel  (delete one hybridization), and set  startover = true  (maybe deleting that hybridization did not fix other gamma zero problems)  If bad t, then set  startover = false  If left second while by back to original  currT , and still bad h/hz, then move down one level, and  startover=true ; otherwise  startover=false       If first while ends by  tries N , then it checks one last time the flags, if bad h/hz will move down one level, and exit  source",
