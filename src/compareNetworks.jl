`hardwiredClusters(net::HybridNetwork, S::Union{Vector{String},Vector{Int}})`


Returns a matrix describing all the hardwired clusters in a network.
Warnings: Clusters are rooted, so the root must be correct.
          Allows for missing taxa, with entries all 0.

Each row corresponds to one internal edge, that is, external edges are excluded.
If the root is a leaf node, the external edge to that leaf is included (first row).
Both parent hybrid edges to a given hybrid node only contribute a single row (they share the same hardwired cluster).

- first column: edge number
- next columns: 0/1 values. 1=descendant of edge, 0=not a descendant, or missing taxon.
- last column:  10/11 values. 10=tree edge, 11=hybrid edge

    ladderpartition(tree::HybridNetwork)

For each node in `tree`, calculate the clade below each child edge of the node,
and each clade moving up the "ladder" from the node to the root. The output is a
tuple of 2 vectors (node) of vector (clade) of vectors (taxon in clade):
`below,above`. More specifically, for node number `n`,
`below[n]` is generally of vector of 2 clades: one for the left child and one
for the right child of the node (unless the node is of degree 2 or is a polytomy).
`above[n]` contains the grade of clades above node number `n`.

WARNING: assumes that
1. node numbers and edge numbers can be used as indices, that is,
   be all distinct, positive, covering exactly 1:#nodes and 1:#edges.
2. edges are corrected directed (`isChild1` is up-to-date) and
   nodes have been pre-ordered already (field `nodes_changed` up-to-date).

`hardwiredClusterDistance(net1::HybridNetwork, net2::HybridNetwork, rooted::Bool)`

Takes 2 networks and returns their hardwired cluster distance, that is,
the number of hardwired clusters found in one network and not in the other.
Note that this is not a distance per se on the full space of hybrid networks:
there are pairs of different networks for which this measure is 0.
But it is a distance on some network subspaces.

If the 2 networks are trees, this is the Robinson-Foulds distance.
If rooted=false, the trees are considered unrooted.
