# functions to add hybridizations to a semi-directed network

    addhybridedge!(net::HybridNetwork, nohybridladder::Bool, no3cycle::Bool,
                   constraints=TopologyConstraint[]::Vector{TopologyConstraint};
                   maxattempts=10::Int, fixroot=false::Bool)

Randomly choose two edges in `net` then: add hybrid edge from edge 1 to edge 2
of length 0.01. The two halves of edge 1 (and of edge 2) have equal lengths.
The hybrid partner edge (top half of edge 2, if fixroot is true) will point
towards the newly-created node on the middle of the original edge 2.

If the resulting network is a DAG, satisfies the constraint(s),
does not contain any 3-cycle (if `no3cycle=true`), and does not have
a hybrid ladder (if `nohybridladder=true`) then the proposal is successful:
`net` is modified, and the function returns the newly created hybrid node and
newly created hybrid edge.

If the resulting network is not acceptable, then a new set of edges
is proposed (using a blacklist) until one is found acceptable, or until
a maximum number of attempts have been made (`maxattempts`).
If none of the attempted proposals are successful, `nothing` is returned
(without causing an error).

After a pair of edges is picked, the "top" half of edge2 is proposed
as the partner hybrid edge with probability 0.8 if `fixroot` is false,
(to avoid changing the direction of edge2 with more than 50% chance)
and with probability 1.0 if `fixroot` is true.
If this choice does not work and if `fixroot` is false,
the other half of edge2 is proposed as the partner hybrid edge.
Note that choosing the "bottom" half of edge2 as the partner edge
requires to flip the direction of edge 2, and to move the root accordingly
(to the original child of edge2).

                   edgelength=-1.0::Float64, gamma=-1.0::Float64)

Add hybridization to `net` coming from `edge1` going into `edge2`.
2 new nodes and 3 new edges are created: `edge1` are `edge2` are both cut into 2 edges,
and a new edge is created linking the 2 new "middle" nodes, pointing from `edge1` to `edge2`.
The new node in the middle of `edge1` is a tree node.
The new node in the middle of `edge2` is a hybrid node.
Its parent edges are the newly created hybrid edge (with γ = gamma, missing by default),
and either the newly edge "above" `edge2` if `hybridpartnernew=true`,
or the old `edge2` otherwise (which would reverse the direction of `edge2` and others).

Should be called from the other method, which performs a bunch of checks.
Updates `containRoot` attributes for edges below the new hybrid node.

Output: new hybrid node (middle of the old `edge2`) and new hybrid edge.
