    phyLiNC!(net::HybridNetwork, fastafile::String, modSymbol::Symbol,
             rateCategories=1::Int)

Estimate a phylogenetic network from concatenated DNA data using
maximum likelihood, ignoring incomplete lineage sorting
(phyLiNC: phylogenetic Likelihood Network from Concatenated data).
The network is constrained to have `maxhybrid` reticulations at most,
but can be of any level.
The search starts at (or near) the network `net`,
using a local hill-climbing search to optimize the topology
(nearest-neighbor interchange moves, add hybridizations,
and remove hybridizations). Also optimized are evolutionary rates,
amount of rate variation across sites, branch lengths and inheritance γs.
This search strategy is run `nruns` times, and the best of the `nruns`
networks is returned.

Return a [`StatisticalSubstitutionModel`](@ref) object, say `obj`, which
contains the estimated network in `obj.net`.

The length of the edge below a reticulation is not identifiable.
Therefore, phyLiNC estimates the canonical version of the network: with
reticulations **unzipped**: edges below reticulations are set to 0, and
hybrid edges (parental lineages) have estimated lengths that are
increased accordingly.

Optional arguments include (default value in parenthesis):
- `rateCategories` (1): number of categories to use in estimating variable evolutionary
  rates using a discretized gamma model. If `rateCategories` = 1, no rate variation
  is included. To allow for rate variation, four categories is typically used.
  See [`RateVariationAcrossSites`] (@ref)
- `nruns` (10): number of independent starting points for the search
- `filename` ("phyLiNC"): root name for the output files (`.out`, `.err`).
  If empty (""), files are *not* created, progress log goes to the screen only
  (standard out).
- `maxhybrid` (1): maximum number of hybridizations allowed
- `no3cycle` (true): prevents 3-cycles, which are (almost) not
  identifiable
- `nohybridladder` (true): prevents hybrid ladder in network. If true,
  the input network must not have hybrid ladders.
- `maxmoves` (100): maximum number of topology moves before branch lengths,
  hybrid γ values, evolutionary rates, and rate variation parameters are
  reestimated.
- `verbose` (true): set to false to turn off screen output
- `seed` (default 0 to get it from the clock): seed to replicate a given search
- `probST` (0.5): probability to use `net` as the starting topology
  for each given run. If probST < 1, the starting topology is k NNI moves
  away from `net`, where k is drawn from a geometric distribution: p (1-p)ᵏ,
  with success probability p = `probST`.
- `speciesfile` (""): path to a csv file containing two columns:
  species and individuals used to create one or more species topology
  constraints to meet during the search.
- `cladefile` (""): path to a csv file containing two columns:
  clades and individuals used to create one or more clade topology
  constraints to meet during the search.
  (NOTE: clade contraints not yet implemented.)
- `alphamin` (0.02): minimum value for shape parameter alpha in rate variation
  across sites model.
- `alphamax` (50.0): maximum value for shape parameter alpha in rate variation
  across sites model.

The following optional arguments control when to stop the optimization of branch
lengths and gamma values on each individual candidate network. Defaults in
parentheses.
- `ftolRel` (1e-6) and `ftolAbs` (1e-6): relative and absolute differences of the
  network score between the current and proposed parameters
- `xtolRel` (1e-5) and `xtolAbs` (1e-5): relative and absolute differences
  between the current and proposed parameters.
Greater values will result in a less thorough but faster search. These parameters
are used when evaluating candidate networks only.
Regardless of these arguments, once a final topology is chosen, branch lenghts
are optimized using stricter tolerances (1e-10, 1e-12, 1e-10, 1e-10) for better
estimates.

The following optional arguments control when to stop proposing new
network topologies:

- `nreject` (75): maximum number of times that new topologies are
  proposed and rejected in a row. Lower values of `nreject` result in a less
  thorough but faster search.

Alternate NNI moves, hybrid additions / deletions, and root changes based on their
respective weights in `moveweights_LiNC` ([0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]).
Branch lengths and hybrid γs around the NNI focal edge or around the
added / deleted hybrid edge are optimized (roughly) on the proposed
network. Each proposed network is accepted --or not-- if the likelihood
improves (or doesn't decrease much for hybrid deletion).
After adding or removing a hybrid, `obj` is updated, to have correct
displayed `trees` and node/edge numberings: done by [`nni_LiNC!`](@ref),
[`addhybridedgeLiNC!`](@ref) and [`deletehybridedgeLiNC!`](@ref).

Output: number of consecutive rejections so far.

The percent of nni moves, hybrid additions, hybrid deletions, and root changes
to be performed is in `PhyloNetworks.moveweights_LiNC`.

- `maxmoves`: maximum number of moves to be performed, including root changes,
  which don't actually change the semi-directed topology and likelihood.
- `nreject`: number of consecutive rejections (ignoring root changes), prior
  to starting the search (from a prior function call)
- `nrejectmax`: the search stops when there has been this number of moves that
  have been rejected in a row (ignoring root changes)

For a description of other arguments, see [`phyLiNC!`](@ref).

Assumptions:
- `checknetworkbeforeLiNC` and `discrete_corelikelihood!` have been called on
  `obj.net`.
- starting with a network without 2- and 3- cycles
  (checked by `checknetworkbeforeLiNC`)

Note: When removing a hybrid edge, always removes the minor edge.

Calibrate branch lengths in `net` by minimizing the mean squared error
between the JC-adjusted pairwise distance between taxa, and network-predicted
pairwise distances, using [`calibrateFromPairwiseDistances!`](@ref).
`siteweight[k]` gives the weight of site (or site pattern) `k` (default: all 1s).
`unzip` = true sets all edges below a hybrid node to length zero.

Assumptions:

- all species have the same number of traits (sites): `length(trait[i])` constant
- `trait[i]` is for leaf with `node.number = i` in `net`, and
  `trait[i][j] = k` means that leaf number `i` has state index `k` for trait `j`.
  These indices are those used in a substitution model:
  kth value of `getlabels(model)`.
- Hamming distances are < 0.75 with four states, or < (n-1)/n for n states.
  If not, all pairwise hamming distances are scaled by `.75/(m*1.01)` where `m`
  is the maximum observed hamming distance, to make them all < 0.75.
