    phyLiNC(net::HybridNetwork, fastafile::String, substitutionModel::Symbol)

Estimate a phylogenetic network from concatenated DNA data using
maximum likelihood, ignoring incomplete lineage sorting
(phyLiNC: phylogenetic Likelihood Network from Concatenated data).
The network is constrained to have `maxhybrid` reticulations at most,
but can be of any level.
The search starts at (or near) the network `net`,
using a local hill-climbing search to optimize the topology
(nearest-neighbor interchange moves, add hybridizations,
and remove hybridizations). Also optimized are evolutionary rates,
amount of rate variation across sites, branch lengths and inheritance γs.
This search strategy is run `nruns` times, and the best of the `nruns`
networks is returned.

Return a [`StatisticalSubstitutionModel`](@ref) object, say `obj`, which
contains the estimated network in `obj.net`.

Required arguments:
- `net`: a network or tree of type `HybridNetwork`, to serve as a starting point
  in the search for the best network.
  Newick strings can be converted to this format with [`readTopology`] (@ref).
- `fastafile`: file with the sequence data in FASTA format. Ambiguous states are
  treated as missing.
- `substitutionModel`: A symbol indicating which substitution model is used.
  Choose `:JC69` [`JC69`](@ref) for the Jukes-Cantor model or `:HKY85` for
  the Hasegawa, Kishino, Yano model [`HKY85`](@ref).

The length of the edge below a reticulation is not identifiable.
Therefore, phyLiNC estimates the canonical version of the network: with
reticulations **unzipped**: edges below reticulations are set to 0, and
hybrid edges (parental lineages) have estimated lengths that are
increased accordingly.

If any branch lengths are missing in the input network, phyLiNC estimates the
starting branch lengths using pairwise distances. Otherwise, it uses the input branch
lengths as starting branch lengths, only unzipping all reticulations, as
described above.

Optional arguments (default value in parenthesis):
-  symbol for the model of rate variation across sites
  (`:noRV` for no rate variation):
  use `:G` or `:Gamma` for Gamma-distributed rates,
  `:I` or `:Inv` for a proportion of invariable sites, and
  `:GI` or `:GammaInv` for a combination (not recommended).
- integer (4) for the number of categories to use in estimating
  evolutionary rates using a discretized gamma model. When allowing for rate
  variation, four categories is standard. With 1 category,
  no rate variation is assumed. See [`RateVariationAcrossSites`] (@ref).

Main optional keyword arguments (default value in parenthesis):
- `speciesfile` (""): path to a csv file with samples in rows and two columns:
  species (column 1), individual (column 2)
  Include this file to group individuals by species.
- `cladefile` (""): path to a csv file containing two columns:
  clades and individuals used to create one or more clade topology
  constraints to meet during the search.
  (NOTE: clade contraints not yet implemented.)
- `filename` ("phyLiNC"): root name for the output files (`.out`, `.err`).
  If empty (""), files are *not* created, progress log goes to the screen only
  (standard out).
- `maxhybrid` (1): maximum number of hybridizations allowed.
  `net` (starting network) must have `maxhybrid` or fewer reticulations.
- `nruns` (10): number of independent starting points for the search
- `no3cycle` (true): prevents 3-cycles, which are (almost) not
  identifiable
- `nohybridladder` (true): prevents hybrid ladder in network. If true,
  the input network must not have hybrid ladders.
  Warning: Setting this to true will avoid most hybrid ladders, but some can still
  occur in some cases when deleting hybrid edges. This might be replaced with an
  option to avoid all non-tree-child networks in the future.

Optional arguments controlling the search:
- `seed` (default 0 to get it from the clock): seed to replicate a given search
- `nreject` (75): maximum number of times that new topologies are
  proposed and rejected in a row. Lower values of `nreject` result in a less
  thorough but faster search. Controls when to stop proposing new
  network topologies.
- `probST` (0.5): probability to use `net` as the starting topology
  for each given run. If probST < 1, the starting topology is k NNI moves
  away from `net`, where k is drawn from a geometric distribution: p (1-p)ᵏ,
  with success probability p = `probST`.
- `maxmoves` (100): maximum number of topology moves before branch lengths,
  hybrid γ values, evolutionary rates, and rate variation parameters are
  reestimated.
- `verbose` (true): set to false to turn off screen output
- `alphamin` (0.02) and `alphamax` (50.0): minimum and maximum values for
  the shape parameter alpha for Gamma-distributed rates across sites.
- `pinvmin` (1e-8) and `pinvmax` (0.99): minimum and maximum values for
  the proportion of invariable sites, if included in the model.

The following optional arguments control when to stop the optimization of branch
lengths and gamma values on each individual candidate network. Defaults in
parentheses.
- `ftolRel` (1e-6) and `ftolAbs` (1e-6): relative and absolute differences of the
  network score between the current and proposed parameters
- `xtolRel` (1e-5) and `xtolAbs` (1e-5): relative and absolute differences
  between the current and proposed parameters.
Greater values will result in a less thorough but faster search. These parameters
are used when evaluating candidate networks only.
Regardless of these arguments, once a final topology is chosen, branch lenghts
are optimized using stricter tolerances (1e-10, 1e-12, 1e-10, 1e-10) for better
estimates.

        After shrinking cycles, the loglik would be slightly wrong because 3-cycles
        are nearly non-identifiable, not fully non-identifiable. Due to this, we
        shrink cycles only in the middle of optimization, not when optimization is
        finished. By avoiding shrinking cycles at the end, the final loglik is correct.
        This can lead to confusing results for users: They could choose no3cycle=true, but
        still have a 3-cycle in the final network.
        Might want to add something to docs about this. =#

Alternate NNI moves, hybrid additions / deletions / flips, and root changes.
The percent of sNNI moves, hybrid additions, hybrid deletions, hybrid flips, and
root changes performed is `PhyloNetworks.moveweights_LiNC`:
[0.6, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1].

The proposed network is accepted if its likelihood is greater than or equal to
the original likelihood. Root moves cannot change the network's likelihood, so
they are always accepted.

Branch lengths and hybrid γs around the NNI focal edge or around the
altered hybrid edge are optimized (roughly) on the proposed network.
After sNNI or adding, removing, flipping a hybrid, `obj` is updated to have correct
displayed trees and node/edge numberings (done by [`nni_LiNC!`](@ref),
[`addhybridedgeLiNC!`](@ref), [`deletehybridedgeLiNC!`](@ref), and
[`fliphybridedgeLiNC!`](@ref)).

Output: number of consecutive rejections so far.

Arguments:
- `maxmoves`: maximum number of moves to be performed, including root changes,
  which don't actually change the semi-directed topology and likelihood.
- `nreject`: number of consecutive rejections (ignoring root changes), prior
  to starting the search (from a prior function call)
- `nrejectmax`: the search stops when there has been this number of moves that
  have been rejected in a row (ignoring root changes)

For a description of other arguments, see [`phyLiNC`](@ref).

Assumptions:
- `checknetworkbeforeLiNC` and `discrete_corelikelihood!` have been called on
  `obj.net`.
- starting with a network without 2- and 3- cycles
  (checked by `checknetworkbeforeLiNC`)

Note: When removing or flipping a hybrid, the minor edge is removed or flipped.

Deletes a random hybrid edge and updates SSM object as part of
PhyLiNC optimization.
Return true if the move is accepted, false if not.

Note: if net is tree-child and a hybrid edge is deleted, then the
resulting network is still tree-child.
But: if `net` has no hybrid ladders, deleting an existing reticulation
may create a hybrid ladder. It happens if there is a reticulation above a
W structure (tree node whose children are both hybrid nodes).
This creates a problem if the user asked for `nohybridladder`:
this request may not be met.

Constrains branch lengths to zero below hybrid nodes.
Return vector of updated `edges` (excluding constrained edges).
The tolerance values and parameters controlling the search are set in `lcache`.

- branch lengths are at or above the lower bound, and definitely non-negative.

Given a network and data set, optimize branch lengths, γ inheritance weights,
and substitution model parameters.
Return a [`StatisticalSubstitutionModel`](@ref) object, which
includes the network with estimated branch lengths & γs, parameters, and likelihood.

The given topology is fixed. The starting branch lengths are taken from
`net` is *all* of them are provided.
For options, see [`phyLiNC`](@ref).
Tolerance values `ftolRel` etc. are all set to `1e-12`.

Warning: This can change the topology in one way: When an inheritance weight is
optimized to zero, that edge will be removed. If this change creates a 2-cycle,
it will be shrunk.
