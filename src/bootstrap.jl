`listfile` should be the name of a file containing the path/name to multiple
bootstrap files, one on each line (no header). Each named bootstrap file should
contain multiple trees, one per line (such as bootstrap trees from a single gene).

Sample bootstrap gene trees, 1 tree per gene.
Set the seed with keyword argument `seed`, which is 0 by default.
When `seed=0`, the actual seed is set using the clock.
Assumes a vector of vectors of networks (see `readBootstrapTrees`),
each one of length 1 or more (error if one vector is empty, tested in `bootsnaq`).

- site resampling: always, from sampling one bootstrap tree from each given list.
  This tree is sampled at **random** unless `row>0` (see below).
- gene resampling: if `generesampling=true` (default is false),
  genes (i.e. lists) are sampled with replacement.
- `row=i`: samples the ith bootstrap tree for each gene.
  `row` is turned back to 0 if gene resampling is true.

output: one vector of trees. the modifying function (!) modifies the input tree list and returns it.

Read a data frame containing CFs and their credibility intervals, and

Return a data frame with taxon labels in first 4 columns, sampled obs CFs in columns 5-7

  If `seed=-1`, the new df is a deep copy of the input df, with no call to the random
  number generator. Otherwise, `seed` is passed to the modifying function.
- The modifying function overwrites the input data frame with the sampled CFs and returns it.
  If `seed=0`, the random generator is seeded from the clock. Otherwise the random generator
  is seeded using `seed`.

Warning: the modifying version does *not* check the data frame: assumes correct columns.

    bootsnaq(T::HybridNetwork, df::DataFrame)
    bootsnaq(T::HybridNetwork, vector of tree lists)

Bootstrap analysis for SNaQ.
Bootstrap data can be quartet concordance factors (CF),
drawn from sampling uniformly in their credibility intervals,
as given in the data frame `df`.
Alternatively, bootstrap data can be gene trees sampled from
a vector of tree lists: one list of bootstrap trees per locus
(see `readBootstrapTrees` to generate this,
from a file containing a list of bootstrap files: one per locus).

From each bootstrap replicate, a network
is estimated with snaq!, with a search starting from topology `T`.
Optional arguments include the following, with default values in parentheses:

- `hmax` (1): max number of reticulations in the estimated networks
- `nrep` (10): number of bootstrap replicates.
- `runs` (10): number of independent optimization runs for each replicate
- `filename` ("bootsnaq"): root name for output files. No output files if "".
- `seed` (0 to get a random seed from the clock): seed for random number generator
- `otherNet` (empty): another starting topology so that each replicate will start prcnet% runs on otherNet and (1-prcnet)% runs on `T`
- `prcnet` (0): percentage of runs starting on `otherNet`; error if different than 0.0, and otherNet not specified.
- `ftolRel`, `ftolAbs`, `xtolRel`, `xtolAbs`, `liktolAbs`, `Nfail`,
  `probST`, `verbose`, `outgroup`: see `snaq!`, same defaults.

If `T` is a tree, its branch lengths are first optimized roughly with [`updateBL!`](@ref)
(by using the average CF of all quartets defining each branch and calculating the coalescent units
corresponding to this quartet CF).
If `T` has one or more reticulations, its branch lengths are taken as is to start the search.
The branch lengths of `otherNet` are always taken as is to start the search.

"""
`hybridBootstrapSupport(boot_net::Vector{HybridNetwork}, ref_net::HybridNetwork; rooted=false)`

Match hybrid nodes in a reference network with those in an array of networks,
like bootstrap networks.
All networks must be fully resolved, and on the same taxon set.
If `rooted=true`, all networks are assumed to have been properly rooted beforehand.
Otherwise, the origin of each hybrid edge is considered as an unrooted bipartition (default).

Two hybrid edges in two networks are said to match if they share the same "hybrid" clade
(or recipient) and the same "donor clade", which is a sister to the hybrid clade in the network.
Since a hybrid clade has 2 parent edges, it is sister to two clades simultaneously: one is its
major sister (following the major hybrid edge with Î³>0.5) and one is its minor sister (following
the major hybrid edge with Î³<0.5).

To calculate these hybrid and sister clades at a given hybrid node, all other hybrid edges are
first removed from the network. Then, the hybrid clade is the hardwired cluster (descendants) of
either hybrid edge and major/minor clade is the hardwired cluster of the sibling edge of the
major/minor hybrid parent.
If `rooted=false`, sister clades are considered as bipartitions.

Output:

1. a "node" data frame (see below)
2. an "edge" data frame (see below)
3. a "clade" data frame to describe the make up of all clades found as hybrids or sisters,
   starting with a column `taxa` that lists all taxa. All other columns correspond to a given
   clade and contain true/false values. `true` means that a given taxon belongs in a given clade.
   For a clade named `H1`, for instance, and if the data frame was named `cla`, the
   list of taxa in this clade can be obtained with `cla[:taxa][cla[:H1]]`.
4. an array of gamma values, with one row for each bootstrap network and two columns (major/minor)
   for each hybrid edge in the reference network. If this hybrid edge was found in the bootstrap network
   (i.e. same hybrid and sister clades, after removal of all other hybrid nodes),
   its bootstrap gamma value is recorded here. Otherwise, the gamma entry is 0.0.
5. a vector with the number of each hybrid edge in the reference network,
   in the same order as for the columns in the array of gamma values above.

The "node" data frame has one row per clade and 9 columns giving:

   - `:clade`: the clade's name, like the taxon name (if a hybrid is a single taxon) or
     the hybrid tag (like 'H1') in the reference network
   - `:node`: the node number in the reference network. missing if the clade is not in this network.
   - `:hybridnode`: typically the same node number as above, except for hybrid clades in the
     reference network. For those, the hybrid node number is listed here.
   - `:edge`: number of the parent edge, parent to the node in column 2,
     if found in the ref network. missing otherwise.
   - `:BS_hybrid`: percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be a hybrid clade.
   - `:BS_sister`: percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be sister to
     some hybrid clade (sum of the next 2 columns)
   - `:BS_major_sister`: percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be the
     major sister to some hybrid clade
   - `:BS_minor_sister`: same as previous, but minor
   - `:BS_hybrid_samesisters`: percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be
     a hybrid and with the same set of sister clades as in the reference network.
     Applies to hybrid clades found in the reference network only, missing for all other clades.

The "edge" data frame has one row for each pair of clades, and 8 columns:

  - `:edge`: hybrid edge number, if the edge appears in the reference network. missing otherwise.
  - `:hybrid_clade`: name of the clade found to be a hybrid, descendent of 'edge'
  - `:hybrid`: node number of that clade, if it appears in the reference network. missing otherwise.
  - `:sister_clade`: name of the clade that is sister to 'edge', i.e. be sister to a hybrid
  - `:sister`: node number of that clade, if in the ref network.
  - `:BS_hybrid_edge`: percentage of bootstrap networks in which 'edge' is found to be a hybrid
     edge, i.e. when the clade in the 'hybrid' column is found to be a hybrid and the clade in
     the 'sister' column is one of its sisters.
  - `:BS_major`: percentage of bootstrap networks in which 'edge' is found to be a major hybrid
     edge, i.e. when 'hybrid' is found to be a hybrid clade and 'sister' is found to be its
     major sister.
  - `:BS_minor`: same as previous, but minor
