constraints:
- species groups e.g. as polytomies (type 1), or
- clades in the major tree (type 2), or
- clades in *some* displayed tree (type 3, not implemented).
outgroups "grades" can be coded as ingroup clades

move types, all under topological constraints:
- NNI = nearest neighbor interchange for undirected network,
  similar to NNIs for rooted networks defined in
  Gambette, van Iersel, Jones, Lafond, Pardi and Scornavacca (2017),
  Rearrangement moves on rooted phylogenetic networks.
  PLOS Computational Biology 13(8):e1005611.
- move the root: needed for optimization of a semi-directed network,
  because the root position affects the feasibility of the
  NNIs starting from a BR configuration (bifurcation -> reticulation).

- remove a hybrid edge: `deletehybridedge!` in file deleteHybrid.jl,
  but does not check for clade constraints
- add a hybrid edge: in file addHybrid.jl
- change the direction of a hybrid edge

in `moves_snaq.jl`, functions are tailored to level-1 networks;
here, functions apply to semidirected networks of all levels.

    TopologyConstraint(type::UInt8, taxonnames::Vector{String}, net::HybridNetwork)

Create a topology constraint from user-given type, taxon names, and network.
There are 3 types of constraints:

- type 1: A set of tips that forms a species.
- type 2: A set of tips that forms a clade in the major tree.
  Note that the root matters. Constraining a set of species to be an outgroup
  is equivalent to constraining the ingroup to form a clade.
- type 3: A set of tips that forms a clade in any one of the displayed trees.

Note: currently, with type-1 constraints, hybridizations are prevented
from coming into or going out of a species group.

"""
    nni!(net::HybridNetwork, e::Edge, nohybridladder::Bool=true, no3cycle::Bool=true,
         constraints=TopologyConstraint[]::Vector{TopologyConstraint})

Attempt to perform a nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) around edge `e`,
randomly chosen among all possible NNIs (e.g 3, sometimes more depending on `e`)
satisfying the constraints, and such that the new network is a DAG. The number of
possible NNI moves around an edge depends on whether the edge's parent/child nodes
are tree or hybrid nodes. This is calculated by [`nnimax`](@ref).

The option `no3cycle` forbids moves that would create a 3-cycle in the network.
When `no3cycle` = false, 2-cycle and 3-cycles may be generated.

Note that the defaults values are for positional (not keyword) arguments, so
two or more arguments can be used, but in a specific order: nni!(net, e) or
nni!(net, e, nohybridladder),
nni!(net, e, nohybridladder, no3cycle),
nni!(net, e, nohybridladder, no3cycle, contraints).

Assumptions:
- The starting network does not have 3-cycles, if `no3cycle=true`.
  No check for the presence of 2- and 3-cycles in the input network.
- The edges' field `isChild1` is correct in the input network. (This field
  will be correct in the output network.)

Output:
information indicating how to undo the move or `nothing` if all NNIs failed.

Return the information necessary to undo the NNI, or `nothing` if the move
was not successful (such as if the resulting graph was not acyclic (not a DAG) or if
the focus edge is adjacent to a polytomy). If the move fails, the network is not
modified.
`nummove` specifies which of the available NNIs is performed.

rooted-NNI options according to Gambette et al. (2017), fig. 8:
* BB: 2 moves, both to BB, if directed edges. 8 moves if undirected.
* RR: 2 moves, both to RR.
* BR: 3 moves, 1 RB & 2 BRs, if directed. 6 moves if e is undirected.
* RB: 4 moves, all 4 BRs.
The extra options are due to assuming a semi-directed network, whereas
Gambette et al (2017) describe options for rooted networks.
On a semi-directed network, there might be a choice of how to direct
the edges that may contain the root, e.g. choice of e=uv versus vu, and
choice of labelling adjacent nodes as α/β (BB), or as α/γ (BR).

`nohybridladder` = true prevents moves that would create a hybrid ladder in
the network, that is, 2 consecutive hybrid nodes (one parent of the other).
`no3cycle` = true prevents NNI moves that would make a 3-cycle, and assumes
that the input network does not have any 2- or 3-cycles.
If `no3cycle` is false, 3-cycles can be generated, but NNIs generating
2-cycles are prevented.

The edge field `isChild1` is assumed to be correct according to the `net.root`.

    nni!(αu, u, uv::Edge, v, vδ)
    nni!(αu,u,uv,v,vδ, flip::Bool, inner::Bool, indices)

Transform a network locally around the focus edge `uv` with
the following NNI, that detaches u-β and grafts it onto vδ:

    α - u -- v ------ δ
        |    |
        β    γ

    α ------ v -- u - δ
             |    |
             γ    β

`flip` boolean indicates if the uv edge was flipped
`inner` boolean indicates if edges αu and uv both point toward node u,
i.e. α->u<-v<-δ. If this is true, we flip the hybrid status of αu and vδ.

`indices` give indices for nodes and edges u_in_αu, αu_in_u, vδ_in_v, and v_in_vδ.
These are interpreted as:

    u_in_αu: the index for u in the edge αu
    αu_in_u: the index for αu in node u
    vδ_in_v: the index for vδ in node v
    v_in_vδ: the index for v in edge vδ

**Warnings**:

- *No* check of assumed adjacencies
- Not implemented for cases that are not necessary thanks to symmetry,
  such as cases covered by `nni!(vδ, v, uv, u, αu)` or `nni!(βu, u, v, vγ)`.
  More specifically, these cases are not implemented (and not checked):
  * u not hybrid & v hybrid
  * u hybrid, v not hybrid, α -> u <- v -> δ
- Because of this, `nni(αu,u,uv,v,vδ, ...)` should not be used directly;
  use instead `nni!(net, uv, move_number)`.
- nni!(undoinfo...) restores the topology, but edges below hybrid nodes
  will have length 0.0 even if they didn't before.

Node numbers and edge numbers are not modified.
Edge `uv` keeps its direction unchanged *unless* the directions were
`α -> u -> v -> δ` or `α <- u <- v <- δ`,
in which case the direction of `uv` is flipped.

The second version's input has the same signature as the output, but
will undo the NNI more easily. This means that if `output = nni!(input)`,
then `nni!(output...)` is valid and undoes the first operation.

Right now, branch lengths are not modified except when below a hybrid node.
Future versions might implement options to modify branch lengths.

Flip the direction of a single hybrid edge:
the minor parent edge of `hybridnode` by default,
or the major parent edge if `minor` is false.
The parent node of the hybrid edge becomes the new hybrid node.
The former hybrid edge partner is converted to a tree edge (with γ=1),
and `hybridnode` becomes a tree node.

For the flip to be admissible, the new network must be a semi-directed
phylogenetic network: with a root such that the rooted version is a DAG.
If `nohybridladder` is false (default), the flip may create a hybrid ladder
If `nohybridladder` is true and if the flip would create a hybrid ladder,
then the flip is not admissible.
A hybrid ladder is when a hybrid child of another hybrid.

The new hybrid partner is an edge adjacent to the new hybrid node,
such that the flip is admissible (so it must be a tree edge).
The flipped edge retains its original γ.
The new hybrid edge is assigned inheritance 1-γ.

Output:
`(newhybridnode, flippededge, oldchildedge)` if the flip is admissible,
`nothing` otherwise.

The network is unchanged if the flip is not admissible.
If the flip is admissible, the root position may be modified, and
the direction of tree edges (via `isChild1`) is modified accordingly. If the
root needs to be modified, then the new root is set to the old hybrid node.

The index of the new hybrid node in `net.hybrid` is equal to that of the
old `hybridnode`.

Warning: Undoing this move may not recover the original root if
the root position was modified.
