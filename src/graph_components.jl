    biconnectedComponents(network, ignoreTrivial=false)

Calculate biconnected components (aka "blobs") using Tarjan's algorithm.

Output: array of arrays of edges.
- the length of the array is the number of blobs
- each element is an array of all the edges inside a given blob.

These blobs are returned in post-order, but within a blob,
edges are *not* necessarily sorted in topological order.
If `ignoreTrivial` is true, trivial components (of a single edge)
are not returned.
The network is assumed to be connected.

*Warnings*: for nodes, fields `k` and `inCycle`
are modified during the algorithm. They are used to store the
node's "index" (time of visitation), "lowpoint", and the node's
"parent", as defined by the order in which nodes are visited.
For edges, field `fromBadDiamondI` is modified, to store whether
the edge has been already been visited or not.

Warnings:
- the forest is represented by a single HybridNetwork object,

field appropriately, using the `membership` output by [`treeedgecomponents`](@ref).
A node is appropriate to serve as root if it belongs in the
root tree-edge component, that is, the root of the tree-edge component graph.

- If the current root is appropriate, it is left as is. The direction of
  edges (via `isChild1`) is also left as is, assuming it was in synch with
  the existing root.
- Otherwise, the root is set to the first appropriate node in `net.node`,
  that is not a leaf. Then edges are directed away from this root.

A `RootMismatch` error is thrown if `net` is not a valid semidirected
phylogenetic network (i.e. it is not possible to root the network in a way
compatible with the given hybrid edges).

Output: the `membership` ID of the root component.
The full set of nodes in the root component can be obtained as shown below.
Warning: only use the output component ID after calling the second version
