Break an edge into 2 edges, each of length half that of original edge,

Return the new node and the new edge, which is the "top" half of the
original starting edge.

`ischild1` and `containroot` are updated, but not internal fields
(e.g. not those used by SNaQ for level-1 networks).

Delete *all* nodes of degree two in `net`, fusing the two adjacent edges

If the network has a degree-2 root and `keeproot` is false,
then the root is eliminated as well, leaving the network unrooted.
The only exception to this rule is if the root is incident to 2 (outgoing)
hybrid edges. Removing the root should leave a loop-edge (equal end point),
which we don't want to do, to preserve the paths in the original network.
In this case, the root is maintained even if `keeproot` is false.
If `keeproot` is true, then the root is kept even if it's of degree 2.

    rotate!(net::HybridNetwork, nodeNumber::Integer; orderedEdgeNum::Array{Int,1})

Rotates the order of the node's children edges. Useful for plotting,
to remove crossing edges.
If `node` is a tree node with no polytomy, the 2 children edges are switched
and the optional argument `orderedEdgeNum` is ignored.

Use `plot(net, shownodenumber=true, showedgenumber=false)` to map node and edge numbers
on the network, as shown in the examples below.
(see package [PhyloPlots](https://github.com/juliaphylo/PhyloPlots.jl))

Warning: assumes that edges are correctly directed (ischild1 updated). This is done
by `plot(net)`. Otherwise run `directedges!(net)`.

# Example

```julia
julia> net = readnewick("(A:1.0,((B:1.1,#H1:0.2::0.2):1.2,(((C:0.52,(E:0.5)#H2:0.02::0.7):0.6,(#H2:0.01::0.3,F:0.7):0.8):0.9,(D:0.8)#H1:0.3::0.8):1.3):0.7):0.1;");
julia> using PhyloPlots
julia> plot(net, shownodenumber=true)
julia> rotate!(net, -4)
julia> plot(net)
julia> net=readnewick("(4,((1,(2)#H7:::0.864):2.069,(6,5):3.423):0.265,(3,#H7:::0.136):10.0);");

julia> plot(net)
```

Note that `LinearAlgebra` also exports a function named `rotate!` in Julia v1.5.
If both packages need to be used in Julia v1.5 or higher,
usage of `rotate!` needs to be qualified, such as with `PhyloNetworks.rotate!`.

    deleteleaf!(HybridNetwork, leafName::AbstractString; ...)
    deleteleaf!(HybridNetwork, Node; ...)
    deleteleaf!(HybridNetwork, Integer; index=false, ...)

Delete a node from the network, possibly from its name, number, or index
in the network's array of nodes.
The first two versions require that the node is a leaf.
The third version does **not** require that the node is a leaf:
If it has degree 3 or more, nothing happens.
If it has degree 1 or 2, then it is deleted.

## keyword arguments

`simplify`: if true and if deleting the node results in 2 hybrid edges
forming a cycle of k=2 nodes, then these hybrid edges are merged and
simplified as a single tree edge.

`unroot`: if true, a root of degree 1 or 2 is deleted. If false,
the root is deleted if it is of degree 1 (no root edge is left),
but is kept if it is of degree 2. Deleting all leaves in an outgroup
clade or grade will leave the ingroup rooted
(that is, the new root will be of degree 2).

`nofuse`: if true, keep nodes (and edges) provided that they have at least
one descendant leaf, even if they are of degree 2.
This will keep two-cycles (forcing `simplify` to false).
Nodes without any descendant leaves are deleted.
If `nofuse` is false, edges adjacent to degree-2 nodes are fused.

`multgammas`: if true, the fused edge has Î³ equal to the product of
the hybrid edges that have been fused together, which may result in
tree edges with Î³<1, or with reticulations in which the two parent
Î³ don't add up to 1.

`keeporiginalroot`: if true, keep the root even if it is of degree one
(forcing `unroot` to be false).

Warning: does **not** update edges' `containroot` nor internal attributes
(e.g. those used by SNaQ for level-1 networks).
Does not require branch lengths, and designed to work on networks
of all levels.

Delete a hybrid `edge` from `net` and return the network.
The network does not have to be of level 1 and may contain polytomies,
although each hybrid node must have exactly 2 parents.
Branch lengths are updated, allowing for missing values.

If `nofuse` is false, when `edge` is removed, its child (hybrid) node is removed
and its partner hybrid edge is removed.
Its child edge is retained (below the hybrid node), fused with the former partner,
with new length: old length + length of `edge`'s old partner.
Any 2-cycle is simplified into a single edge, unless `simplify` is false.

If `nofuse` is true, edges with descendant leaves are kept as is,
and are not fused. Nodes are retained during edge removal,
provided that they have at least one descendant leaf.
The hybrid edge that is partner to `edge` becomes a tree edge,
but has its Î³ value unchanged (it is not set to 1), since it is not merged
with its child edge after removal of the reticulation.  
Also, 2-cycles are not simplified if `nofuse` is true.
That is, if we get 2 hybrid edges both from the same parent to the same child,
these hybrid edges are retained without being fused into a single tree edge.

If `unroot` is false and if the root is up for deletion during the process,
it will be kept if it's of degree 2 or more.
A root node of degree 1 will be deleted unless `keeporiginalroot` is true.

If `multgammas` is true: inheritance weights are kept by multiplying together
the inheritance Î³'s of edges that are merged. For example,
if there is a hybrid ladder, the partner hybrid edge remains a hybrid edge
(with a new partner), and its Î³ is the product of the two hybrid edges
that have been fused. So it won't add up to 1 with its new partner's Î³.

If `keeporiginalroot` is true, a root of degree one will not be deleted.

Warnings:

- `containroot` is updated, but this requires correct `ischild1` fields
- if the parent of `edge` is the root and if `nofuse` is false, the root
  is moved to keep the network unrooted with a root of degree two.
- does *not* update attributes needed for snaq! (like inte1, edge.z, edge.y etc.)

"""
    resetnodenumbers!(net::HybridNetwork; checkPreorder=true, type=:ape)

Change internal node numbers of `net` to consecutive numbers from 1 to the total
number of nodes.

keyword arguments:
- `type`: default is `:ape`, to get numbers that satisfy the conditions assumed by the
  `ape` R package: leaves are 1 to n, the root is n+1, and internal nodes
  are higher consecutive integers.
  If `:postorder`, nodes are numbered in post-order,
  with leaves from 1 to n (and the root last).
  If `:internalonly`, leaves are unchanged. Only internal nodes are modified,
  to take consecutive numbers from (max leaf number)+1 and up. With this
  last option, the post-ordering of nodes is by-passed.
- `checkPreorder`: if false, the `ischild1` edge field and the `net.vec_node`
  network field are supposed to be correct (to get nodes in preorder).
  This is not needed when `type=:internalonly`.

of "nested" zippers: when the child of a hybrid node is itself a hybrid node.
