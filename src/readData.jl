    readTableCF!(data frame, columns)

Read in quartet CFs from data frame, assuming information is in columns numbered `columns`,
of length **7 or 8**: 4 taxon labels then 3 CFs then ngenes possibly.

If some species appears more than once in the same 4-taxon set (e.g. t1,t1,t2,t3),
then the data frame is modified to remove rows (4-taxon sets) that are uninformative about
between-species relationships. This situation may occur if multiple individuals are sampled from
the same species. A 4-taxon set is uninformative (and its row is removed)
if one taxon is repeated 3 or 4 times (like t1,t1,t1,t1 or t1,t2,t2,t2).
The list of species appearing twice in some 4-taxon sets is stored in the output DataCF object.
For these species, the length of their external edge is identifiable (in coalescent units).
If multiple rows correspond to the same 4-taxon set, these rows are merged and their CF values
(and number of genes) are averaged.

    readTableCF!(DataCF, data frame, columns)

Modify the `.quartet.obsCF` values in the `DataCF` object with those read from the data frame
in columns numbered `columns`.
`columns` should have **3** columns numbers for the 3 CFs in this order: 12_34, 13_24 and 14_23.

Assumptions:
- same 4-taxon sets in `DataCF` and in the data frame, and in the same order,
  but this assumption is *not checked* (for speed, e.g. during bootstrapping).
- one single row per 4-taxon set (multiple individuals representatives
  of the same 4-taxon set should have been already merged);
  basically: the DataCF should have been created from the data frame by `readTableCF!(df, colums)`
