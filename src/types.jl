# procedure to create hybrid network:
# 1) create edges defined as hybrid or not
# 2) create nodes with such edges
# 3) setNode! to add nodes into edges
# 4) create hybrid network

"""
 `ANode`

Abstract node. An object of type [`Edge`](@ref) has a `node` attribute,
which is an vector of 2 `ANode` objects.
The object of type [`Node`](@ref) is an `ANode`, and has an `edge` attribute,
which is vector of `Edge` objects.
"""
abstract type ANode end

"""
    Edge(number)

Data structure for an edge and its various attributes. Most notably:
- `number` (integer): serves as unique identifier;
  remains unchanged when the network is modified,
  with a nearest neighbor interchange for example
- `node`: a vector of [`Node`]s, normally just 2 of them
- `isChild1` (boolean): `true` if `node[1]` is the child node of the edge,
  false if `node[1]` is the parent node of the edge
- `length`: branch length
- `hybrid` (boolean): whether the edge is a tree edge or a hybrid edge
  (in which case `isChild1` is important, even if the network is semi-directed)
- `gamma`: proportion of genetic material inherited by the child node via the edge;
  1.0 for a tree edge
- `isMajor` (boolean): whether the edge is the major path to the child node;
  `true` for tree edges, since a tree edge is the only path to its child node;
  normally true if `gamma>0.5`.

"""
    Node(number, leaf)

Data structure for an edge and its various attributes. Most notably:

- `number` (integer): serves as unique identifier;
  remains unchanged when the network is modified,
  with a nearest neighbor interchange for example
- `leaf` (boolean): whether the node is a leaf (with data typically) or an
  internal node (no data typically)
- `name` (string): taxon name for leaves; internal node may or may not have a name
- `edge`: vector of [`Edge`]s that the node is attached to;
  1 if the node is a leaf, 2 if the node is the root, 3 otherwise, and
  potentially more if the node has a polytomy
- `hybrid` (boolean): whether the node is a hybrid node (with 2 or more parents)
  or a tree node (with a single parent)

Other more internal attributes include:

- `isBadDiamondI` and `isBadDiamondII` (booleans): whether the node is a
  hybrid node where the reticulation forms a cycle of 4 nodes (diamond),
  and where both parents of the hybrid nodes are connected to a leaf.
  In a bad diamond of type I, the hybrid node itself is also connected
  to a leaf but the common neighbor of the 2 hybrid's parents is not connected
  to a leaf.
  In a bad diamond of type II, the hybrid node has an internal node as child,
  and the common neighbor of the 2 hybrid's parents is connected to a leaf.
- `isBadTriangle`, `isVeryBadTriangle` and `isExtBadTriangle` (booleans):
  true if the reticulation forms a cycle of 3 nodes (triangle) and
  depending on the number of leaves attached these 3 nodes. The triangle means
  that the 2 parents of the hybrid node are directly related:
  one is the child of the other. `isBadTriangle` is true if the triangle is
  "good", as per Solís-Lemus & Ané (2016), that is, if all 3 nodes in the cycle
  are not connected to any leaves (the reticulation is detectable from quartet
  concordance factors, even though all branch lengths are not identifiable).
  `isVeryBadTriangle` is true if 2 (or all) of the 3 nodes are connected to a
  leaf, in which case the reticulation is undetectable from unrooted gene tree
  topologies (thus it's best to exclude these reticulations from a search).
  `isBadTriangle` is true if exactly 1 of the 3 nodes is connected to a leaf.

    DataCF

type that contains the following attributes:

- quartet (vector of Quartets)
- numQuartets
- tree (vector of trees: empty if a table of CF was input instead of list of trees)
- numTrees (-1 if a table CF was input instead of list of trees)
- repSpecies (taxon names that were repeated in table of CF or input gene trees: used inside snaq for multiple alleles case)

The list of Quartet may be accessed with the attribute .quartet.
If the input was a list of trees, the HybridNetwork's can be accessed with the attribute .tree.
For example, if the DataCF object is named d, d.quartet[1] will show the first quartet
and d.tree[1] will print the first input tree.
