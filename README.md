## Overview

PhyloNetworks is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package with utilities to
to handle phylogenetic trees and networks.
It serves as a core package that other packages can depend on, such as
[PhyloPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPhylo/PhyloPlots.jl)
to visualize phylogenies,
[SNaQ](https://github.com/JuliaPhylo/PhyloPlots.jl)
to infer phylogenies from genetic data,
[PhyloPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPhylo/PhyloPlots.jl)
to analyze the evolution of traits along phylogenies.

Phylogenetic networks represent the evolutionary relationships between a set
of organisms, e.g. populations, species, languages, cultures etc.
They are also called *admixture graphs* when their leaves are populations
of the same or closely related species.
They are *explicit* graph representations, in which nodes represent
ancestral populations / species, and edge lengths represent evolutionary time.

Utilities in this core package include:
- read / write phylogenies in (extended) Newick format
- manipulate networks: re-root, prune taxa, remove hybrid edges,
  transform a network with a semidirected nearest-neighbor interchange (sNNI),
  extract the major tree from a network, extract displayed networks / trees
- compare networks with dissimilarity measures
  (e.g. the Robinson-Foulds distance on trees)
- summarize samples of networks with support for local features
  (edges and clades of hybrid origin or sister to a hybrid clade)
- fit edges lengths from average pairwise distances between leaves,
  using least-squares
- network traversal routines
