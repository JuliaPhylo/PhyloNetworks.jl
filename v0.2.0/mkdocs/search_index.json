This is something to type every time you start a Julia session:\n\n\nusing PhyloNetworks;\n\n\n\n\nThis step can also take a while, if Julia needs to pre-compile the code (after a package update for instance).

We show here small example on how to get more info on an object, what's its type, and how to manipulate objects. For example, let's take an object \nd\n created from reading in some data (see \nInput for SNaQ\n):\n\n\nd=readTrees2CF(\ntableCF.txt\n);\n\n\n\n\nTyping the following command will provide a list of objects saved in memory, including \nd\n that we just created:\n\n\nwhos()\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to know the type of a particular object, we do:\n\n\ntypeof(d)\n\n\n\n\nwhich shows us that \nd\n if of type \nDataCF\n.

We can also ask for a list of all its attributes with\n\n\nfieldnames(d)\n\n\n\n\nFor example, we see that one attribute is \nnumQuartets\n: its the number of 4-taxon subsets in the data. To see what this number is:\n\n\nd.numQuartets\n\n\n\n\nWe also noticed an attribute \nquartet\n. It is a vector of Quartet objects inside \nd\n, so\n\n\nd.quartet[1].taxon\n\n\n\n\nwill provide the list of taxon names for the first 4-taxon subset in the data. We can corroborate this is the firs 4-taxon subset by checking the file \ntableCF.txt\n.\n\n\nTo see the observed CF, we can type\n\n\nd.quartet[1].obsCF\n\n\n\n\nWe can verify the type with\n\n\ntypeof(d.quartet[1])\n\n\n\n\nYou can also read a simple network in Julia and print the list of edges\n\n\nstr = \n(A,((B,#H1),(C,(D)#H1)));\n;\nnet = readTopology(str)\nprintEdges(net)\n\n\n\n\nYou see that the edges do not have branch lengths, and the hybrid edges do not have gamma values, you can set them with\n\n\nsetLength!(net.edge[1],1.9)\nsetGamma!(net.edge[3],0.8)\nprintEdges(net)\n\n\n\n\nwhere 1 and 3 correspond to the position of the given edge to modify in the list of edges.

The pipeline starts from the sequence alignments, runs MrBayes and then BUCKy (both parallelized), producing the table of estimated CFs and their credibility intervals. Additional details on this \nTICR pipeline\n describe how to insert data at various stages (e.g. after running MrBayes on each locus).\n\n\n\n\nTutorial data: gene trees\n\n\n We suggest that you create a special directory for running these examples, where input files can be downloaded and where output files will be created (with estimated networks for instance). Enter this directory and run Julia from there.\n\n\nSuppose you have a file with a list of gene trees in parenthetical format called \ntreefile.txt\n. You can access the example file of input trees \nhere\n or \nhere\n for easier download.\n\n\nDo not copy-paste into a \"smart\" text-editor. Instead, save the file directly into your working directory using \"save link as\" or \"download linked file as\". This file contains 10 trees, each in parenthetical format on 6 taxa like this:\n\n\n(6:2.728,((3:0.655,5:0.655):1.202,(1:0.881,(2:0.783,4:0.783):0.098):0.976):0.871);\n\n\nIf 'treefile.txt' is in your working directory, you can view its content within Julia:\n\n\nless(\ntreefile.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nJust type \nq\n to quit viewing this file. You could read in these 10 trees and visualize the third one (say) like this:\n\n\ntentrees = readMultiTopology(\ntreefile.txt\n)\ntentrees[3]\nplot(tentrees[3])\n\n\n\n\nTo read in all gene trees and directly summarize them by a list of quartet CFs (proportion of input trees with a given quartet):\n\n\nd=readTrees2CF(\ntreefile.txt\n, CFfile=\ntableCFall.txt\n)\nless(\ntableCFall.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nless(\"tableCFall.txt\")\n lets you see the content of the newly created file \"tableCFall.txt\", within Julia. Again, type \nq\n to quit viewing this file.\n\n\nIf instead of all the 4-taxon subsets, you just want to use a random sample of 10 4-taxon subsets:\n\n\nd=readTrees2CF(\ntreefile.txt\n, whichQ=\nrand\n, numQ=10, CFfile=\ntableCF10.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nBe careful to use a numQ value smaller than the total number of possible 4-taxon subsets, which is \nn choose 4\n on \nn\n taxa (e.g. 15 on 6 taxa). To get a predictable random sample, you may set the seed with \nsrand(12321)\n (for instance) prior to sampling the quartets as above.\n\n\n\n\nTutorial data: quartet CFs\n\n\nIf you already have a table of quartet concordance factor (CF) values in a file \ntableCF.txt\n in this format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxon1\n\n\nTaxon2\n\n\nTaxon3\n\n\nTaxon4\n\n\nCF12_34\n\n\nCF13_24\n\n\nCF14_23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nB\n\n\nE\n\n\nD\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou would read it like this:\n\n\nd=readTableCF(\ntableCF.txt\n) # one step only: read file and convert to 'DataCF' object\n# or in 2 steps:\nusing DataFrames\ndat = readtable(\ntableCF.txt\n) # read file into a 'DataFrame' object\nd = readTableCF(dat)           # convert DataFrame into DataCF\n\n\n\n\nYou can access this example file \nhere\n or \nhere\n.\n\n\nColumns need to be in the right order. If you have the information on the number of genes used for each 4-taxon subset, you can add this information in a column named \"ngenes\".\n\n\nIf you have a tree \nstartTree.txt\n in parenthetical format to use as starting point for the optimization, you can read it with\n\n\nT=readTopology(\nstartTree.txt\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou can access this example file \nhere\n (raw file \nhere\n).\n\n\nIf the topology \nT\n is to be used as a starting tree for SNaQ, it needs to be of level 1.

Instead, save the file directly into your working directory using \"save link as\" or \"download linked file as\". This file contains 10 trees, each in parenthetical format on 6 taxa like this:  (6:2.728,((3:0.655,5:0.655):1.202,(1:0.881,(2:0.783,4:0.783):0.098):0.976):0.871);  If 'treefile.txt' is in your working directory, you can view its content within Julia:  less( treefile.txt )  Just type  q  to quit viewing this file. You could read in these 10 trees and visualize the third one (say) like this:  tentrees = readMultiTopology( treefile.txt )\ntentrees[3]\nplot(tentrees[3])  To read in all gene trees and directly summarize them by a list of quartet CFs (proportion of input trees with a given quartet):  d=readTrees2CF( treefile.txt , CFfile= tableCFall.txt )\nless( tableCFall.txt )  less(\"tableCFall.txt\")  lets you see the content of the newly created file \"tableCFall.txt\", within Julia. Again, type  q  to quit viewing this file.  If instead of all the 4-taxon subsets, you just want to use a random sample of 10 4-taxon subsets:  d=readTrees2CF( treefile.txt , whichQ= rand , numQ=10, CFfile= tableCF10.txt )  Be careful to use a numQ value smaller than the total number of possible 4-taxon subsets, which is  n choose 4  on  n  taxa (e.g. 15 on 6 taxa). To get a predictable random sample, you may set the seed with  srand(12321)  (for instance) prior to sampling the quartets as above.",

Make sure that your downloaded file has the name \ntableCFCI.csv\n (to match the name in the Julia command), with no an extra extension \n.txt\n. Rename the file after download if necessary.\n\n\nThis example uses a number of replicates (10) that is definitely too small, to make the example run faster. You might also increase the number of optimization runs (\nruns\n) done for each bootstrap replicate.\n\n\nThe bootstrap networks are saved in the \nboostrap.out\n file, so they can be read in a new session with \nbootnet = readMultiTopology(\"boostrap.out\")\n. To save the bootstrap networks to a different file (perhaps after having re-rooted them with an outgroup), you can do this:\n\n\nwriteMultiTopology(bootnet, \nbootstrapNets_h1.tre\n)\nlength(bootnet) # 10 networks in the array 'bootnet'\nless(\nbootstrapNets_h1.tre\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf you close your session and re-open it later, you can re-read the bootstrap networks back in memory like this:\n\n\nbootnet = readMultiTopology(\nbootstrapNets_h1.tre\n);\n\n\n\n\nWe can run bootstrap analysis from gene trees also. We need a text file with a list of files containg the bootstrap trees (one file per gene). This is the same format used by ASTRAL (see the wiki page for more details.).\n\n\nbootTrees = readBootstrapTrees(\nBSlistfiles\n)\nbootnet = bootsnaq(T, bootTrees, hmax=1, nrep=100, filename=\nbootsnaq1_raxmlboot\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf you used a specified list of quartets on the original data, you should use that same list for the bootstrap analysis through the option \nquartetfile\n.\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing bootstrap on the main tree\n\n\nThe \nbootsnaq\n function, as used before, returned a list of 10 networks (\nnrep=10\n). Before summarizing them on the best network, it is best to re-read this network to get a reproducible internal numbering of its nodes and edges, used later for mapping bootstrap support to edges. We can then summarize bootstrap networks:\n\n\nnet1 = readTopology(\nnet1_snaq.out\n) # reading from output file of snaq\nBStable, tree1 = treeEdgesBootstrap(bootnet,net1)\n\n\n\n\nThis will calculate the major tree \ntree1\n displayed in \nnet1\n, that is, the tree obtained by following the major parent (\u03b3\n0.5) of each hybrid node. This tree can be visualized like this, with edge numbers shown for later use.\n\n\nrootatnode!(net1, \n4\n)\nrootatnode!(tree1, \n4\n)\nplot(tree1, showEdgeNumber=true)\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can look at bootstrap table \nBStable\n, which has one row for each tree edge in \nnet1\n. One column contains the edge number (same as shown in the plot) and another column contains the edge bootstrap support: the proportion of bootstrap replicates in which this edge was found in the major tree of the inferred network. We can see the full bootstrap table and see which tree edges have bootstrap support lower than 100% with\n\n\nshowall(BStable)\nBStable[BStable[:proportion] .\n 1.0, :]\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can map the bootstrap proportions onto the network or its main tree by passing the bootstrap table to the \nedgeLabel\n option of \nplot\n:\n\n\nplot(tree1, edgeLabel=BStable)\nplot(net1,  edgeLabel=BStable)\n\n\n\n\n(Here, it is important that the numbers assigned to edges when building the boostrap table \u2013those in \nnet1\n at the time\u2013 correspond to the current edge numbers in \ntree1\n and \nnet1\n. That was the purpose of reading the network from the output file of snaq! earlier, for consistency across different Julia sessions.)\n\n\nIf we wanted to plot only certain bootstrap values, like those below 100% (1.0), we could do this:\n\n\nplot(net1, edgeLabel=BStable[BStable[:proportion] .\n 1.0, :])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing bootstrap on reticulations\n\n\nSummarizing the placement of hybridization edges is not standard. The function \nhybridBootstrapSupport\n attempts to do so. The descendants of a given hybrid node form the \"recipient\" or \"hybrid\" clade, and is obtained after removing all other reticulations. If reticulation is due to gene flow or introgression, the minor hybrid edge (with \u03b3\n0.5) represents this event. The descendants of the lineage from which gene flow originated is then a second \"sister\" of the hybrid clade. Because of the reticulation event, the hybrid clade has 2 sister clades, not 1: the major sister (through the major hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5) and the minor sister (through the minor hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5). Note that the network says \nnothing\n about the process: its shows the \nrelationships\n only. We can calculate the frequency that each clade is a hybrid clade, or a major or minor sister for some other hybrid, in the bootstrap networks:\n\n\nBSn, BSe, BSc, BSgam, BSedgenum = hybridBootstrapSupport(bootnet, net1);\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the results. We can list all the clades and the percentage of bootstrap networks (bootstrap support) in which each clade is a hybrid or sister to a hybrid:\n\n\nBSn\n\n\n\n\nIf a clade contains a single taxon, it is listed with its taxon name. The clade found in the best network is listed with its tag, starting with H (e.g. \"H7\"). The name of other clades start with \"c_\" followed by their number in the best network, if they do appear in the best network. The node numbers, as used internally in the best network, are listed in a separate column. They can be used later to display the bootstrap support values onto the network. Various columns give the bootstrap support that each clade is a hybrid, or a (major/minor) sister to a hybrid. The last column gives the bootstrap support for the full relationship in the best network: same hybrid with same two sisters. These bootstrap values are associated with nodes (or possibly, their parent edges).\n\n\nTo see what is the clade named \"H7\", for instance:\n\n\nBSc # this might be too big\nshowall(BSc)\nBSc[:taxa][BSc[:H7]]\n\n\n\n\nWe can also get bootstrap values associated with edges, to describe the support that a given hybrid clade has a given sister clade.\n\n\nBSe\n\n\n\n\nHere, each row describes a pair of 2 clades: one being the hybrid, the other being its sister, connected by a hybrid edge. The first rows corresponds to hybrid edges in the best network. Other rows correspond to edges seen in bootstrap networks but not in the best network.\n\n\nBSedgenum\n\n\n\n\nlists all the hybrid edges in the best network, two for each hybrid node: the major parent edge and then the minor parent edge. In our case, there is only one reticulation, so only 2 hybrid edges.\n\n\nWe can plot the bootstrap values of the 2 hybrid edges in the best network:\n\n\nplot(net1, edgeLabel=BSe[[:edge,:BS_hybrid_edge]])\n\n\n\n\nThis is showing the bootstrap support each hybrid edge: percentage of bootstrap trees with an edge from the same sister clade to the same hybrid clade. Alternatively, we could show the bootstrap support for the full reticulation relationships in the network, one at each hybrid node (support for same hybrid with same sister clades):\n\n\nplot(net1, nodeLabel=BSn[[:hybridnode,:BS_hybrid_samesisters]])\n\n\n\n\nOn a different plot, we can show the bootstrap support for hybrid clades, shown on the parent edge of each node with positive hybrid support:\n\n\nplot(net1, edgeLabel=BSn[BSn[:BS_hybrid].\n0, [:edge,:BS_hybrid]])\n\n\n\n\nor plot the support for minor sister clades (shown along parent edge, and filtered to those with sister support \n 5%):\n\n\nplot(net1, edgeLabel=BSn[BSn[:BS_minor_sister].\n5, [:edge,:BS_minor_sister]])\n\n\n\n\nTo plot the same values next to the associated nodes, rather than edges, we use the option \nnodeLabel\n and we select the column \nnode\n or \nhybridnode\n:\n\n\nplot(net1, nodeLabel=BSn[BSn[:BS_hybrid].\n0, [:hybridnode,:BS_hybrid]])\nplot(net1, nodeLabel=BSn[BSn[:BS_minor_sister].\n5, [:node,:BS_minor_sister]])\nplot(net1, nodeLabel=BSn[BSn[:BS_major_sister].\n5, [:node,:BS_major_sister]])\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated heritability \u03b3 on hybrid edges in the reference network, when present in a bootstrap network, was also extracted:\n\n\nBSgam\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3=0 values are for bootstrap replicates that did not have the edge in their network. Basic summaries on \u03b3 values for a given edge, say the minor parent, could be obtained like this:\n\n\nminimum(BSgam[:,2])\nmaximum(BSgam[:,2])\nmean(BSgam[:,2])\nstd(BSgam[:,2])",

A level-1 network is assumed. The search starts from topology \nT\n, which can be a tree or a network with no more than \nhmax\n hybrid nodes. The function name ends with ! because it modifies the CF data \nd\n by updating its attributes \nexpCF\n: CFs expected under the network model. It does \nnot\n modify \nT\n. The quartet pseudo-deviance is the negative log pseudo-likelihood, up to an additive constant, such that a perfect fit corresponds to a deviance of 0.0.\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n\nestimated network in file \n.out\n (also in \n.log\n): best network overall and list of   networks from each individual run.\n\n\nthe best network and modifications of it, in file \n.networks\n.   All networks in this file have the same undirected topology as the best network,   but have different hybrid/gene flow directions. These other networks are reported with   their pseudo-likelihood scores, because    non-identifiability issues can cause them to have very similar scores, and because    SNaQ was shown to estimate the undirected topology accurately but not the direction of    hybridization in cases of near non-identifiability.\n\n\nif any error occurred, file \n.err\n provides information (seed) to reproduce the error.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many optional arguments, including\n\n\n\n\nhmax: maximum number of hybridizations allowed (default 1)\n\n\nverbose: if true, print information about the numerical optimization\n\n\nruns: number of independent starting points for the search (default 10)\n\n\noutgroup: outgroup taxon to root the estimated topology at the very end\n\n\nfilename: root name for the output files. Default is \"snaq\". If empty (\"\"),   files are \nnot\n created, progress log goes to the screen only (standard out).\n\n\nseed: seed to replicate a given search\n\n\n\n\nThe following optional arguments control when to stop the optimization of branch lengths and \u03b3's on each individual candidate network. Defaults are in parentheses:\n\n\n\n\nftolRel (1e-5) and ftolAbs (1e-6): relative and absolute differences of the network score   between the current and proposed parameters,\n\n\nxtolRel (1e-3) and xtolAbs (1e-4): relative and absolute differences between the current   and proposed parameters.\n\n\n\n\nGreater values will result in a less thorough but faster search. These parameters are used when evaluating candidate networks only. Branch lengths and \u03b3's are optimized on the last \"best\" network with different and very thorough tolerance parameters (1e-12 for ftolRel and 1e-10 for the others).\n\n\nThe following optional arguments control when to stop proposing new network topologies:\n\n\n\n\nNfail (100): maximum number of times that new topologies are proposed and rejected (in a row).\n\n\nM (10000): the proposed network is accepted if its score is better than the current score by   at least M*ftolAbs.\n\n\n\n\nLower values of Nfail and greater values of M would result in a less thorough but faster search.\n\n\nSee also: \ntopologyMaxQPseudolik!\n to optimize parameters on a fixed topology, and \ntopologyQPseudolik!\n to get the deviance (pseudo log-likelihood up to a constant) of a fixed topology with fixed parameters.\n\n\nReference: Claudia Sol\u00eds-Lemus and C\u00e9cile An\u00e9 (2016).

All networks must be fully resolved, and on the same taxon set. If \nrooted=true\n, all networks are assumed to have been properly rooted beforehand. Otherwise, the origin of each hybrid edge is considered as an unrooted bipartition (default).\n\n\nTwo hybrid edges in two networks are said to match if they share the same \"hybrid\" clade (or recipient) and the same \"donor clade\", which is a sister to the hybrid clade in the network. Since a hybrid clade has 2 parent edges, it is sister to two clades simultaneously: one is its major sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5) and one is its minor sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3\n0.5).\n\n\nTo calculate these hybrid and sister clades at a given hybrid node, all other hybrid edges are first removed from the network. Then, the hybrid clade is the hardwired cluster (descendants) of either hybrid edge and major/minor clade is the hardwired cluster of the sibling edge of the major/minor hybrid parent. If \nrooted=false\n, sister clades are considered as bipartitions.\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n\na \"node\" data frame (see below)\n\n\nan \"edge\" data frame (see below)\n\n\na \"clade\" data frame to describe the make up of all clades found as hybrids or sisters,   starting with a column \ntaxa\n that lists all taxa. All other columns correspond to a given   clade and contain true/false values. \ntrue\n means that a given taxon belongs in a given clade.

Otherwise, the gamma entry is 0.0.\n\n\na vector with the number of each hybrid edge in the reference network, in the same order as for the columns in the array of gamma values above.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"node data frame has one row per clade and 9 columns giving:\n\n\n\n\nclade\n: the clade's name, like the taxon name (if a hybrid is a single taxon) or      the hybrid tag (like 'H1') in the reference network\n\n\nnode\n: the node number in the reference network. NA if the clade is not in this network.\n\n\nhybridnode\n: typically the same node number as above, except for hybrid clades in the      reference network.

See also:  rootonedge! .  #  PhyloNetworks.rootonedge!     Function .  rootonedge!(HybridNetwork, edgeNumber::Integer; index=false::Bool)\nrootonedge!(HybridNetwork, Edge)  Roots the network/tree object along an edge with number 'edgeNumber' (by default) or with index 'edgeNumber if index=true. Attributes isChild1 and containRoot are updated along the way.  This adds a new node and a new edge to the network. Use  plot(net, showEdgeNumber=true, showEdgeLength=false)  to visualize and identify an edge of interest.  See also:  rootatnode! .  #  PhyloNetworks.hybridatnode!     Function .  hybridatnode!(net::HybridNetwork, nodeNumber::Integer)  Changes the hybrid in a cycle to the node with number  nodeNumber . This node must be in one (and only one) cycle, otherwise an error will be thrown.  Example #\"  julia  net = readTopology( (A:1.0,((B:1.1,#H1:0.2::0.2):1.2,(((C:0.52,(E:0.5)#H2:0.02::0.7):0.6,(#H2:0.01::0.3,F:0.7):0.8):0.9,(D:0.8)#H1:0.3::0.8):1.3):0.7):0.1; );\njulia  plot(net, showNodeNumber=true)\njulia  hybridatnode!(net, -4)\njulia  plot(net)  #  PhyloNetworks.setLength!     Function .  setLength!(Edge,new length)  set a new length for an object Edge. The new length needs to be positive. For example, if you have a HybridNetwork object net, and do printEdges(net), you can see the list of Edges and their lengths. You can then change the length of the 3rd edge with setLength!(net.edge[3],1.2). If  new length  is above 10, the value 10 will be used, as an upper limit to coalescent units that can be reliably estimated.  #  PhyloNetworks.setGamma!     Function .  setGamma!(Edge,new gamma)  set \u03b3 for an edge, which must be a hybrid edge. The new \u03b3 needs to be in (0,1). The \u03b3 of the sister hybrid edge is changed accordingly, to 1-\u03b3. If  net  is a HybridNetwork object,  printEdges(net)  will show the list of edges and their \u03b3's. The \u03b3 of the third hybrid edge (say) can be changed to 0.2 with  setGamma!(net.edge[3],0.2) . This will automatically set \u03b3 of the sister hybrid edge to 0.8.  #  PhyloNetworks.deleteleaf!     Function .  deleteleaf!(HybridNetwork, leafName::AbstractString; simplify=true)\ndeleteleaf!(HybridNetwork, Node; simplify=true)\ndeleteleaf!(HybridNetwork, Integer; index=false, simplify=true)  Deletes a leaf node from the network, possibly from its name, number, or index in the network's array of nodes.  simplify: if true and if deleting the node results in 2 hybrid edges forming a cycle of k=2 nodes, then these hybrid edges are merged and simplified as a single tree edge.  The first 2 versions require that  node  is a leaf. The 3rd version does  not  require that  node  is a leaf. If  node  has degree 3 or more, nothing happens. If it has degree 1 or 2, it is deleted.  Warning: does  not  update attributes related to level-1 networks, such as inCycle, partition, gammaz, etc. Does not require branch lengths, and designed to work on networks of all levels.  #  PhyloNetworks.deleteHybridThreshold!     Function .  deleteHybridThreshold!(net::HybridNetwork,gamma::Float64)  Deletes from a network all hybrid edges with heritability below a threshold gamma. Returns the network.   if gamma 0.5: deletes     minor hybrid edges with gamma value    threshold  if gamma=0.5: deletes all minor hybrid edges (i.e gamma value  = threshold)   Warning: assumes correct isMajor attributes.  #  Gadfly.plot     Function .      function plot(data_source::@compat(Union{AbstractMatrix, AbstractDataFrame}),\n              elements::ElementOrFunctionOrLayers...; mapping...)  Create a new plot.  Grammar of graphics style plotting consists of specifying a dataset, one or more plot elements (scales, coordinates, geometries, etc), and binding of aesthetics to columns or expressions of the dataset.  For example, a simple scatter plot would look something like:  plot(my_data, Geom.point, x=\"time\", y=\"price\")  Where \"time\" and \"price\" are the names of columns in my_data.  Args:   data_source: Data to be bound to aesthetics.  elements: Geometries, statistics, etc.  mapping: Aesthetics symbols (e.g. :x, :y, :color) mapped to names of columns in the data frame or other expressions.   function plot(data_source::@compat(Union{(@compat Void), AbstractMatrix, AbstractDataFrame}),\n              mapping::Dict, elements::ElementOrFunctionOrLayers...)  The old fashioned (pre named arguments) version of plot.  This version takes an explicit mapping dictionary, mapping aesthetics symbols to expressions or columns in the data frame.  Args:   data_source: Data to be bound to aesthetics.  mapping: Dictionary of aesthetics symbols (e.g. :x, :y, :color) to             names of columns in the data frame or other expressions.  elements: Geometries, statistics, etc.   Returns:  A Plot object.  plot(net::HybridNetwork; useEdgeLength=false, mainTree=false, showTipLabel=true,\n     showNodeNumber=false, showEdgeLength=false, showGamma=false, edgeColor=colorant black ,\n     majorHybridEdgeColor=colorant deepskyblue4 , minorHybridEdgeColor=colorant deepskyblue ,\n     showEdgeNumber=false, showIntNodeLabel=false, edgeLabel=[], nodeLabel=[])  Plots a network, from left to right.   useEdgeLength: if true, the tree edges and major hybrid edges are   drawn proportionally to their length. Minor hybrid edges are not, however.   Note that edge lengths in coalescent units may scale very poorly with time.  mainTree: if true, the minor hybrid edges are ommitted.  showTipLabel: if true, taxon labels are shown. You may need to zoom out to see them.  showNodeNumber: if true, nodes are labelled with the number used internally.  showEdgeLength: if true, edges are labelled with their length (above)  showGamma: if true, hybrid edges are labelled with their heritability (below)  edgeColor: color for tree edges. black by default.  majorHybridEdgeColor: color for major hybrid edges  minorHybridEdgeColor: color for minor hybrid edges  showEdgeNumber: if true, edges are labelled with the number used internally.  showIntNodeLabel: if true, internal nodes are labelled with their names.   Useful for hybrid nodes, which do have tags like '#H1'.  edgeLabel: dataframe with two columns: the first with edge numbers, the second with labels   (like bootstrap values) to annotate edges. empty by default.  nodeLabel: dataframe with two columns: the first with node numbers, the second with labels   (like bootstrap values for hybrid relationships) to annotate nodes. empty by default.   Note that  plot  actually modifies some (minor) attributes of the network, as it calls  directEdges! ,  preorder!  and  cladewiseorder! .  If hybrid edges cross tree and major edges, you may choose to rotate some tree edges to eliminate crossing edges, using  rotate! .  #  PhyloNetworks.rotate!     Function .  rotate!(net::HybridNetwork, nodeNumber::Integer; orderedEdgeNum::Array{Int,1})  Rotates the order of the node's children edges. Useful for plotting, to remove crossing edges. If  node  is a tree node with no polytomy, the 2 children edges are switched and the optional argument  orderedEdgeNum  is ignored.  Use plot(net, showNodeNumber=true, showEdgeNumber=false) to map node and edge numbers on the network, as shown in the examples below.  Warning: assumes that edges are correctly directed (isChild1 updated). This is done by plot(net). Otherwise run directEdges!(net).  Example #\"  julia  net = readTopology( (A:1.0,((B:1.1,#H1:0.2::0.2):1.2,(((C:0.52,(E:0.5)#H2:0.02::0.7):0.6,(#H2:0.01::0.3,F:0.7):0.8):0.9,(D:0.8)#H1:0.3::0.8):1.3):0.7):0.1; );\njulia  plot(net, showNodeNumber=true)\njulia  rotate!(net, -4)\njulia  plot(net)\njulia  net=readTopology( (4,((1,(2)#H7:::0.864):2.069,(6,5):3.423):0.265,(3,#H7:::0.136):10.0); );\njulia  plot(net, showNodeNumber=true, showEdgeNumber=true)\njulia  rotate!(net, -1, orderedEdgeNum=[1,12,9])\njulia  plot(net, showNodeNumber=true, showEdgeNumber=true)\njulia  rotate!(net, -3)\njulia  plot(net)",

It sets any missing branch length to 1.0.  If the network has a bad diamond II (in which edge lengths are \u03b3's are not identifiable) and if the edge below this diamond has a length  t  different from 0, then this length is set back to 0 and the major parent hybrid edge is lengthened by  t .  #  PhyloNetworks.readInputTrees     Function .  readInputTrees(file)  function to read a text file with a list of trees in parenthetical format (one tree per line), it returns an array of HybridNetwork object.  #  PhyloNetworks.readMultiTopology     Function .  readMultiTopology(file)  Read a text file with a list of networks in parenthetical format (one per line).

Optional arguments include:   quartetfile: name of text file with list of 4-taxon subsets to be analyzed. If none is specified, the function will list all possible 4-taxon subsets.  whichQ=\"rand\": to choose a random sample of 4-taxon subsets  numQ: size of random sample (ignored if whichQ is not set to \"rand\")  writeTab=false: does not write the observedCF to a table (default true)  CFfile: name of file to save the observedCF (default tableCF.txt)  writeQ=true: save intermediate files with the list of all 4-taxon subsets and chosen random sample (default false).  writeSummary: write descriptive stats of input data (default: true)   #  PhyloNetworks.readTableCF     Function .  readTableCF(file)\nreadTableCF(data frame)\nreadTableCF!(data frame)  Read a file or DataFrame object containing a table of concordance factors (CF), with one row per 4-taxon set. The first 4 columns are assumed to give the labels of the 4 taxa in each set (tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4). Columns containing the CFs are assumed to be named 'CF12_34', 'CF13_24' and 'CF14_23', or else are assumed to be columns 5,6,7. If present, a column named 'ngenes' will be used to get the number of loci used to estimate the CFs for each 4-taxon set.  Optional arguments:   summaryfile: if specified, a summary file will be created with that name.  sep (for the first form only): to specify the type of separator in the file,   with single quotes: sep=';'. Default is a  csv  file, i.e.  sep=',' .   The last version modifies the input data frame, if species are represented by multiple alleles for instance (see  readTableCF! ).  #  PhyloNetworks.readTableCF!     Function .  readTableCF!(data frame, columns)  Read in quartet CFs from data frame, assuming information is in columns numbered  columns , of length  7 or 8 : 4 taxon labels then 3 CFs then ngenes possibly.  If some species appears more than once in the same 4-taxon set (e.g. t1,t1,t2,t3), then the data frame is modified to remove rows (4-taxon sets) that are uninformative about between-species relationships. This situation may occur if multiple individuals are sampled from the same species. A 4-taxon set is uninformative (and its row is removed) if one taxon is repeated 3 or 4 times (like t1,t1,t1,t1 or t1,t2,t2,t2). The list of species appearing twice in some 4-taxon sets is stored in the output DataCF object. For these species, the length of their external edge is identifiable (in coalescent units). If multiple rows correspond to the same 4-taxon set, these rows are merged and their CF values (and number of genes) are averaged.  readTableCF!(DataCF, data frame, columns)  Modify the  .quartet.obsCF  values in the  DataCF  object with those read from the data frame in columns numbered  columns .  columns  should have  3  columns numbers for the 3 CFs in this order: 12_34, 13_24 and 14_23. Assume the same 4-taxon sets in  DataCF  and in the data frame, and in the same order, but this assumption is  not checked  (for speed, e.g. during bootstrapping).  #  PhyloNetworks.readBootstrapTrees     Function .  readBootstrapTrees(filename)  input: name of file containing the path/name to multiple bootstrap files, one per line. Each bootstrap file corresponds to bootstrap trees from a single gene.  output: vector of vectors of trees.  #  PhyloNetworks.writeTopology     Function .  writeTopology(net)\nwriteTopology(net, filename)  write the parenthetical extended Newick format of a HybridNetwork object, as a string or to a file. Optional arguments (default values):   di (false): write in format for Dendroscope  round (false): rounds branch lengths and heritabilities \u03b3  digits (3): digits after the decimal place for rounding   If the current root placement is not admissible, other placements are tried. The network is updated with this new root placement, if successful.  #  PhyloNetworks.writeMultiTopology     Function .  writeMultiTopology(nets, file_name; append=false)\nwriteMultiTopology(nets, IO)  Write an array of networks in parenthetical extended Newick format, one network per line.

The function name ends with ! because it modifies the CF data  d  by updating its attributes  expCF : CFs expected under the network model. It does  not  modify  T . The quartet pseudo-deviance is the negative log pseudo-likelihood, up to an additive constant, such that a perfect fit corresponds to a deviance of 0.0.  Output:   estimated network in file  .out  (also in  .log ): best network overall and list of   networks from each individual run.  the best network and modifications of it, in file  .networks .   All networks in this file have the same undirected topology as the best network,   but have different hybrid/gene flow directions. These other networks are reported with   their pseudo-likelihood scores, because    non-identifiability issues can cause them to have very similar scores, and because    SNaQ was shown to estimate the undirected topology accurately but not the direction of    hybridization in cases of near non-identifiability.  if any error occurred, file  .err  provides information (seed) to reproduce the error.

Defaults are in parentheses:   ftolRel (1e-5) and ftolAbs (1e-6): relative and absolute differences of the network score   between the current and proposed parameters,  xtolRel (1e-3) and xtolAbs (1e-4): relative and absolute differences between the current   and proposed parameters.   Greater values will result in a less thorough but faster search. These parameters are used when evaluating candidate networks only. Branch lengths and \u03b3's are optimized on the last \"best\" network with different and very thorough tolerance parameters (1e-12 for ftolRel and 1e-10 for the others).  The following optional arguments control when to stop proposing new network topologies:   Nfail (100): maximum number of times that new topologies are proposed and rejected (in a row).  M (10000): the proposed network is accepted if its score is better than the current score by   at least M*ftolAbs.   Lower values of Nfail and greater values of M would result in a less thorough but faster search.

Function .  topologyQPseudolik!(net::HybridNetwork, d::DataCF)  Calculate the quartet pseudo-deviance of a given network/tree for DataCF  d . This is the negative log pseudo-likelihood, up to an additive constant, such that a perfect fit corresponds to a deviance of 0.0.  Be careful if the net object does not have all internal branch lengths specified because then the pseudolikelihood will be meaningless.

Note that this is not a distance per se on the full space of hybrid networks: there are pairs of different networks for which this measure is 0. But it is a distance on some network subspaces.  If the 2 networks are trees, this is the Robinson-Foulds distance. If rooted=false, the trees are considered unrooted.  #  PhyloNetworks.treeEdgesBootstrap     Function .  treeEdgesBootstrap(boot_net::Vector{HybridNetwork}, ref_net::HybridNetwork)  read a list of bootstrap networks ( boot_net ) and a reference network ( ref_net ), and calculate the bootstrap support of the tree edges in the reference network.

All networks must be fully resolved, and on the same taxon set. If  rooted=true , all networks are assumed to have been properly rooted beforehand. Otherwise, the origin of each hybrid edge is considered as an unrooted bipartition (default).  Two hybrid edges in two networks are said to match if they share the same \"hybrid\" clade (or recipient) and the same \"donor clade\", which is a sister to the hybrid clade in the network. Since a hybrid clade has 2 parent edges, it is sister to two clades simultaneously: one is its major sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3 0.5) and one is its minor sister (following the major hybrid edge with \u03b3 0.5).  To calculate these hybrid and sister clades at a given hybrid node, all other hybrid edges are first removed from the network. Then, the hybrid clade is the hardwired cluster (descendants) of either hybrid edge and major/minor clade is the hardwired cluster of the sibling edge of the major/minor hybrid parent. If  rooted=false , sister clades are considered as bipartitions.  Output:   a \"node\" data frame (see below)  an \"edge\" data frame (see below)  a \"clade\" data frame to describe the make up of all clades found as hybrids or sisters,   starting with a column  taxa  that lists all taxa. All other columns correspond to a given   clade and contain true/false values.  true  means that a given taxon belongs in a given clade.   For a clade named  H1 , for instance, and if the data frame was named  cla , the   list of taxa in this clade can be obtained with  cla[:taxa][cla[:H1]] .  an array of gamma values, with one row for each bootstrap network and two columns (major/minor)   for each hybrid edge in the reference network. If this hybrid edge was found in the bootstrap network   (i.e. same hybrid and sister clades, after removal of all other hybrid nodes),   its bootstrap gamma value is recorded here. Otherwise, the gamma entry is 0.0.  a vector with the number of each hybrid edge in the reference network, in the same order as for the columns in the array of gamma values above.   The \"node data frame has one row per clade and 9 columns giving:   clade : the clade's name, like the taxon name (if a hybrid is a single taxon) or      the hybrid tag (like 'H1') in the reference network  node : the node number in the reference network. NA if the clade is not in this network.  hybridnode : typically the same node number as above, except for hybrid clades in the      reference network. For those, the hybrid node number is listed here.  edge : number of the parent edge, parent to the node in column 2,      if found in the ref network. NA otherwise.  BS_hybrid : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be a hybrid clade.  BS_sister : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be sister to      some hybrid clade (sum of the next 2 columns)  BS_major_sister : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be the      major sister to some hybrid clade  BS_minor_sister : same as previous, but minor  BS_hybrid_samesisters : percentage of bootstrap networks in which the clade is found to be      a hybrid and with the same set of sister clades as in the reference network.      Applies to hybrid clades found in the reference network only, NA for all other clades.   The \"edge\" data frame has one row for each pair of clades, and 8 columns:   edge : hybrid edge number, if the edge appears in the reference network. NA otherwise.  hybrid_clade : name of the clade found to be a hybrid, descendent of 'edge'  hybrid : node number of that clade, if it appears in the reference network. NA otherwise.  sister_clade : name of the clade that is sister to 'edge', i.e. be sister to a hybrid  sister : node number of that clade, if in the ref network.  BS_hybrid_edge : percentage of bootstrap networks in which 'edge' is found to be a hybrid      edge, i.e. when the clade in the 'hybrid' column is found to be a hybrid and the clade in      the 'sister' column is one of its sisters.  BS_major : percentage of bootstrap networks in which 'edge' is found to be a major hybrid      edge, i.e. when 'hybrid' is found to be a hybrid clade and 'sister' is found to be its      major sister.  BS_minor : same as previous, but minor",
